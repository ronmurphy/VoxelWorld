# Electron Build - ALL ISSUES RESOLVED! üéâ

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Version:** 0.4.6  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Production Ready!

---

## üéä Success Summary

All asset loading issues in the Electron build have been resolved! The game now runs perfectly with:

- ‚úÖ **166 enhanced graphics assets** loading correctly
- ‚úÖ **88 entity portraits** displaying (not emoji fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ **29 tool icons** with enhanced graphics
- ‚úÖ **19 food items** with graphics
- ‚úÖ **5 time period icons** loading
- ‚úÖ **Background music** playing and looping
- ‚úÖ **Emoji picker** working with Google emoji images
- ‚úÖ **Combat system** showing entity graphics
- ‚úÖ **Companion system** fully functional

---

## Final Console Output (Success)

```
üéµ MusicSystem initialized
üéµ Loading music: "/music/forestDay.ogg" ‚Üí "music/forestDay.ogg" (electron: true)
üéµ Now playing: music/forestDay.ogg (Volume: 50%)
```

**Translation:** Music is loading with the correct path conversion and playing successfully! üéµ

## Issues Fixed (In Order)

### 1. ‚úÖ Tree Trunk Textures Missing
**Problem:** Wood blocks showed solid colors instead of bark textures  
**Cause:** Preload script not loading, so multi-face texture discovery failed  
**Fix:** Changed electron.cjs to use `app.getAppPath()` for preload path  
**Result:** Tree textures now display bark patterns!

### 2. ‚úÖ Entity/Tool/Food Images Not Loading (404 Errors)
**Problem:** All entity portraits, tools, and food showed emoji fallbacks  
**Cause:** Code hardcoded `.png` extensions, but files were `.jpeg`  
**Fix:** Implemented multi-extension fallback that tries `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`  
**Result:** All 166 assets loading with correct extensions!

### 3. ‚úÖ Ghost Entity Missing Extension
**Problem:** Ghost paths were `art/entities/ghost` (no extension)  
**Cause:** Helper function returned only the image, path was constructed separately  
**Fix:** Modified `tryLoadEntityImage()` to return `{ image, path }` with full path  
**Result:** Ghost entities display enhanced graphics!

### 4. ‚úÖ Music Files Not Loading
**Problem:** Path `/music/forestDay.ogg` tried to load from filesystem root  
**Cause:** Absolute paths don't work with `file://` protocol in Electron  
**Fix 1:** Added path conversion in MusicSystem (remove leading slash)  
**Fix 2:** Exposed `window.isElectron` in preload script for detection  
**Result:** Background music plays and loops! üéµ

### 5. ‚úÖ Emoji Picker Not Loading Images
**Problem:** Emoji datasource tried to load from `/node_modules/...` (absolute path)  
**Cause:** Same issue - absolute paths don't work in Electron  
**Fix:** Use relative path `../node_modules/...` when in Electron  
**Result:** Emoji picker UI works with Google emoji images!

---

## Technical Solutions

### Multi-Extension Fallback Pattern

All image loading now uses this robust pattern:

```javascript
const tryLoadEntityImage = async (baseName) => {
    // 1. Try known extension from filesystem discovery first (fastest)
    const knownExt = this.fileExtensionMap?.entities?.[baseName];
    if (knownExt) {
        try {
            const path = `${basePath}/${baseName}${knownExt}`;
            const image = await this._loadImage(path);
            return { image, path }; // Return both image AND path!
        } catch (e) { /* fallback */ }
    }
    
    // 2. Try all common extensions
    for (const ext of ['.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg']) {
        try {
            const path = `${basePath}/${baseName}${ext}`;
            const image = await this._loadImage(path);
            return { image, path }; // Success! Store the working extension
        } catch (e) { /* continue */ }
    }
    
    throw new Error(`No image found for ${baseName}`);
};
```

**Key Insight:** Return the FULL path including the extension that actually worked, so it can be used later.

### Electron Path Resolution

The `file://` protocol requires relative paths from the loaded HTML file:

```javascript
const isElectron = window.isElectron?.platform;

// Music files
const fixedPath = isElectron && trackPath.startsWith('/') 
    ? trackPath.substring(1)  // /music/file.ogg ‚Üí music/file.ogg
    : trackPath;

// Emoji datasource
const emojiPath = isElectron
    ? `../node_modules/emoji-datasource-google/...` // Relative from dist/
    : `/node_modules/emoji-datasource-google/...`;  // Absolute for Vite
```

**Why This Works:**
```
Electron loads: file:///app/dist/index.html
Relative path:  music/forestDay.ogg
Resolves to:    file:///app/dist/music/forestDay.ogg ‚úÖ

Absolute path:  /music/forestDay.ogg  
Resolves to:    file:///music/forestDay.ogg ‚ùå (filesystem root!)
```

### Preload Script Enhancement

Added `window.isElectron` convenience property:

```javascript
// electron-preload.cjs
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('electronAPI', {
  platform: process.platform,
  listAssetFiles: async (category) => { /* ... */ }
});

// Also expose a simple flag for easy detection
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('isElectron', {
  platform: process.platform
});
```

**Result:** Both `window.electronAPI` and `window.isElectron` are available for different use cases.

## Expected Console Behavior

### Normal Startup (Not Errors!)

You'll see these 404s during block texture loading - **this is normal**:

```
‚ùå art/blocks/birch_wood-all.jpeg: 404
‚ùå art/blocks/birch_wood-all.jpg: 404
‚ùå art/blocks/birch_wood-all.png: 404
‚úÖ üé® Loaded birch_wood multi-face textures (all=false)
```

**Why?** The code optimistically tries `-all` suffix first (single texture for all faces), then falls back to `-sides` and `-top-bottom` variants. The 404s are caught silently and are part of the fallback system working correctly.

### Success Messages

```
‚úÖ blocks: 26 assets found
‚úÖ tools: 29 assets found
‚úÖ time: 5 assets found
‚úÖ entities: 88 assets found
‚úÖ food: 19 assets found
üé® Asset loading complete: 166 loaded, 0 categories failed
üéµ Loading music: "/music/forestDay.ogg" ‚Üí "music/forestDay.ogg" (electron: true)
üéµ Now playing: music/forestDay.ogg (Volume: 50%)
```

---

## Known Non-Issues

### Items Without Graphics (Intentional)
Some items intentionally use emoji instead of graphics:
- **Mushroom** üçÑ - No art file (uses emoji)
- **Some discovery items** - Emoji looks better than art would

This is **not a bug** - the system falls back to emoji when no image exists, and emoji often looks great!

### Font Warnings (Can Ignore)
```
[DEP0190] DeprecationWarning: Passing args to a child process...
```
This is a Node.js/Electron deprecation warning, not a game issue. It doesn't affect functionality.

---

## Future Improvements (Optional)

1. **Cache Extension Map** - Store successful extensions in localStorage to skip fallback next time
2. **Build-Time Manifest** - Generate manifest.json with all asset paths/extensions during build
3. **Suppress Expected 404s** - Check fileExtensionMap before attempting `-all` variants
4. **Lazy Load Assets** - Load entity graphics on-demand instead of all at startup
5. **Audio Preloading** - Preload music during splash screen for instant playback
