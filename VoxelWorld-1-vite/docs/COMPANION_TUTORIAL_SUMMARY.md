# Companion Tutorial System - Summary

**Making your companion feel alive with context-aware, personality-driven tutorials!**

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
// Machete tutorial hardcoded to slot 5
"Oh! That machete in slot 5 belonged to Uncle Beastly..."

// Workbench tutorial BEFORE UI is visible
// Player can't see what companion is talking about

// No tutorials for Tool Bench or Kitchen Bench
// Players confused by new interfaces
```

### After:
```javascript
// ✅ Dynamically finds which slot machete is in
"Oh! That machete in equipment slot 6 belonged to Uncle Beastly..."

// ✅ Workbench tutorial AFTER UI opens
// Player can see the columns being explained

// ✅ Tool Bench and Kitchen Bench tutorials
// Explains blueprints vs recipes, cooking mechanics

// ✅ First-time item tutorials
// Grappling hook, speed boots, compass, etc.

// ✅ Contextual night warning
// Suggests campfire OR light orbs based on what player has
```

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Slot Detection
```javascript
// Finds machete in any hotbar (1-5) or equipment (6-8) slot
const macheteSlot = this.findItemSlot('machete');
// Returns: { slot: 6, isEquipment: true }

// Tutorial adapts message:
"That machete in equipment slot 6..."
```

### 2. Context-Aware Suggestions
```javascript
// Night falls, companion suggests appropriate safety option:
if (hasToolBench) {
    "Your Tool Bench can make light orbs!"
} else if (hasWorkbench) {
    "Your Workbench can make campfires!"
} else {
    "Once you find your backpack, you'll be able to craft torches..."
}
```

### 3. Interface Explanations
```javascript
// Waits for UI to open, then explains what player can SEE:
onWorkbenchOpened() {
    setTimeout(() => {
        "See those three columns? The left shows materials..."
    }, 500); // UI is visible now!
}
```

### 4. First-Time Item Tutorials
```javascript
// When crafting special items for first time:
onItemCrafted('crafted_grappling_hook')
→ "You crafted a grappling hook! Aim up and right-click..."

onItemCrafted('crafted_speed_boots')
→ "Speed Boots! You'll zip across the world..."

onItemCrafted('stone_hammer')
→ "A stone hammer! Harvest stone for iron ore..."
```

## 🎨 Personality Examples

### Machete
> *"Oh! That machete in slot 2 belonged to Uncle Beastly! He used to chop down trees with it by holding left-click on leaves or trunks. Works on grass, dirt, even stone... and it never dulls! Pretty handy, eh?"*

### Workbench (After Opening)
> *"Nice! You found the Workbench! See those three columns? The left shows what materials you have, the middle is where you build your recipe, and the right shows all the cool stuff you can make!"*

### Tool Bench (After Opening)
> *"Ooh, the Tool Bench! This is where we craft special tools and upgrades using discovery items you find exploring - things like mushrooms, crystals, bones, and rare treasures!"*

### Kitchen Bench (After Opening)
> *"Ah, the Kitchen Bench! Now we're cooking! \*Literally!\* This is where you combine ingredients to make food that gives you special buffs - speed boosts, extra stamina, all sorts of good stuff!"*

### Grappling Hook (First Craft)
> *"Whoa! You crafted a grappling hook! That's one of my favorite tools! It's in slot 7 now! This beauty lets you climb up tall structures and mountains!"*

### First Night
> *"Uh oh, it's getting dark out there... The shadows can hide all sorts of things. You know, your Workbench can make torches and campfires! A campfire would keep you safe AND set your respawn point. Smart investment!"*

### Campfire Placed
> *"Great thinking with that campfire! Not only does it light up the area, but it also sets your respawn point. If something unfortunate happens to you, you'll wake up right here instead of back at spawn. Very smart!"*

## 🔍 Smart Features

### Tracks What's Been Shown
```javascript
// Uses localStorage to remember tutorials
tutorialsSeen: {
    machete: true,
    workbench: true,
    toolBench: false // <- Will show next time
}
```

### One-Time Only
```javascript
// Each tutorial checks before showing
if (this.hasSeen('machete')) return;

// After showing, marks as seen
this.markSeen('machete');
```

### Graceful Fallbacks
```javascript
// If companion not found, uses default
this.companionName = this.getCompanionName(this.companionId);
// Returns 'Scrappy' for rat, 'Companion' if unknown
```

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Reset All Tutorials
```javascript
let playerData = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('NebulaWorld_playerData'));
playerData.tutorialsSeen = {};
localStorage.setItem('NebulaWorld_playerData', JSON.stringify(playerData));
location.reload();
```

### Force Specific Tutorial
```javascript
window.voxelApp.tutorialSystem.showMacheteTutorial();
window.voxelApp.tutorialSystem.showGrapplingHookTutorial();
window.voxelApp.tutorialSystem.showFirstNightTutorial();
```

### Check Tutorial State
```javascript
console.log(window.voxelApp.tutorialSystem.tutorialsSeen);
// Shows: { machete: true, workbench: true, ... }
```
