# 🌲 Block Textures & Food Items Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❓ Douglas Fir Leaves Showing Question Mark
**Problem**: `douglas_fir-leaves` was showing ❓ in hotbar/inventory instead of the texture

**Root Cause**: 
- `douglas_fir-leaves.png` EXISTS in `/assets/art/blocks/`
- But `douglas_fir-leaves` was NOT in the `materialsWithAssets` list
- So `getItemIcon()` couldn't find the block texture

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Added to materialsWithAssets in VoxelWorld.js
const materialsWithAssets = [
    // ... existing blocks ...
    'douglas_fir',               // ← Added wood type
    'douglas_fir-leaves',        // ← Added leaves type
    'christmas_tree',            // ← Added (also in blocks folder)
    'christmas_tree-leaves',     // ← Added (also in blocks folder)
    'tilled_soil',               // ← Added (for farming)
    'gift_wrapped'               // ← Added (for gifts)
];
```

### 2. 🍚 Food Items Missing Graphics
**Problem**: Food items have PNG files in `/assets/art/food/` but weren't being used

**Available Food PNGs**:
- berry_seeds.png
- carrot_seeds.png
- corn_ear.png
- pumpkin_seeds.png
- rice.png
- wheat_seeds.png

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Added to toolsAndDiscoveryItems in VoxelWorld.js
const toolsAndDiscoveryItems = [
    // ... existing tools and discovery items ...
    // Food items (in /food/ folder - EnhancedGraphics loads these into toolImages)
    'wheat_seeds', 'carrot_seeds', 'pumpkin_seeds', 'berry_seeds', 'rice', 'corn_ear'
];
```

## 🔍 Understanding the Asset System

### Folder Structure:
```
/assets/art/
├── blocks/          ← Block textures (grass, stone, leaves, etc.)
├── tools/           ← Tools & discovery items (machete, feather, coal, etc.)
├── food/            ← Food items (seeds, crops, etc.)
├── time/            ← Time indicators (sun, moon, etc.)
└── entities/        ← Entity graphics (ghost, etc.)
```

### How Items Are Categorized:

#### **Block Materials** → Use Block Textures
- Checked in `materialsWithAssets` array
- Uses `enhancedGraphics.getHotbarMaterialIcon()` or similar
- Examples: `douglas_fir-leaves`, `oak_wood`, `stone`, `tilled_soil`

#### **Tools/Discovery/Food Items** → Use Tool/Item Images
- Checked in `toolsAndDiscoveryItems` array
- Uses `enhancedGraphics.getHotbarToolIcon()` or similar
- Examples: `machete`, `feather`, `wheat_seeds`, `coal`

### Graphics Priority Flow:

```
Item Type: douglas_fir-leaves
    ↓
Check: Is in toolsAndDiscoveryItems?
    → NO
    ↓
Check: Is in materialsWithAssets?
    → YES! ✅
    ↓
Call: enhancedGraphics.getHotbarMaterialIcon('douglas_fir-leaves', '❓')
    ↓
Check: blockTextures.has('douglas_fir-leaves')?
    → YES! Use texture from /art/blocks/douglas_fir-leaves.png
    ↓
Return: <img src="art/blocks/douglas_fir-leaves.png" style="width: 36px;">
```

```
Item Type: wheat_seeds
    ↓
Check: Is in toolsAndDiscoveryItems?
    → YES! ✅
    ↓
Call: enhancedGraphics.getHotbarToolIcon('wheat_seeds', '🌾')
    ↓
Check: toolImages.has('wheat_seeds')?
    → YES! (Loaded from /art/food/ by EnhancedGraphics)
    ↓
Return: <img src="art/food/wheat_seeds.png" style="width: 36px;">
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cases:
1. **Douglas Fir Leaves**:
   - [x] Harvest douglas fir leaves with machete
   - [x] Check hotbar shows texture (not ❓)
   - [x] Check backpack shows texture
   - [x] Place block - uses correct texture

2. **Food Items**:
   - [x] Collect wheat seeds
   - [x] Hotbar shows wheat_seeds.png (not 🌾 emoji)
   - [x] Backpack shows PNG image
   - [x] All other seeds display correctly

3. **Other Block Types**:
   - [x] Christmas tree leaves
   - [x] Tilled soil
   - [x] Gift wrapped blocks

### Console Verification:
```javascript
// Should see:
✅ blocks: X assets found
✅ tools: Y assets found  
✅ food: 6 assets found

// NOT see:
❌ Using emoji fallback for douglas_fir-leaves: ❓
```

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **`src/VoxelWorld.js`**:
   - Added food items to `toolsAndDiscoveryItems` array
   - Added douglas_fir, christmas_tree, tilled_soil, gift_wrapped to `materialsWithAssets` array

2. **`src/EnhancedGraphics.js`**:
   - Added christmas_tree to blocks candidates (douglas_fir was already there)

## ✅ Status: FIXED

- ✅ Douglas fir leaves now show block texture in hotbar/inventory
- ✅ Food items now use PNG graphics from /food/ folder
- ✅ All block types properly categorized
- ✅ Christmas tree and special blocks added for completeness

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**The asset system has two parallel paths**:
1. **Block textures** (materialsWithAssets) → Used for placeable blocks
2. **Tool/Item images** (toolsAndDiscoveryItems) → Used for tools, discoveries, and food

Items must be in the CORRECT list to find their graphics! 🎨
