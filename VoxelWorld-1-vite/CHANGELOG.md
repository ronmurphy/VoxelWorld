## 2025-10-10 (Night) - üåæ Farming System Complete: Watering Can & UI Testing Tools

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ**

### üíß Watering Can Implementation

**Overview:**
Completed the farming system with watering can mechanics, particle effects, and auto-work functionality. Crops can now be watered to grow 2x faster with a beautiful visual animation.

**Core Features:**

1. **Watering Can Tool**:
   - Crafted at ToolBench: 3 iron + 1 stick
   - Auto-works from any slot in playerbar (like hoe)
   - Right-click crops to water them
   - Status notification: "üíß Crop watered! Growth speed doubled."
   - Prevents double-watering: "üíß Crop is already watered!"

2. **Water Particle Animation** (AnimationSystem.js):
   - 15 water droplets spawn 2-2.5 blocks above crop
   - Random spread pattern (1.5 block radius)
   - Droplets fall with gravity (velocity: -2 to -3 blocks/sec)
   - Fade out over 1.5 seconds
   - **Proper cleanup**: All geometries, materials, and meshes disposed after animation
   - No memory leaks confirmed

3. **Crop Watering Mechanics** (CropGrowthManager.js):
   - Watered crops grow 2x faster (5 days per stage instead of 10)
   - Watering lasts 1 in-game day
   - Added `isWatered(x, y, z)` method to check watering status
   - Watering expires automatically after 1 day

4. **Auto-Work Detection** (VoxelWorld.js):
   - Uses `hasEquippedTool('watering_can')` to detect tool in playerbar
   - Checks if clicked block is a crop using `farmingBlockTypes[blockType].isCrop`
   - Works with both `watering_can` and `crafted_watering_can`
   - Right-click detection happens BEFORE seed planting to prevent conflicts

**Implementation Files:**

- **AnimationSystem.js** (Lines 195-267):
  - `animateWateringEffect(x, y, z, duration)` - Water particle system
  - 15 droplets with SphereGeometry, blue material, falling animation
  - Proper disposal in `onComplete` callback

- **CropGrowthManager.js**:
  - Lines 65-81: `isWatered(x, y, z)` - Check if crop is currently watered
  - Lines 86-101: `waterCrop(x, y, z)` - Water a crop, set growth boost

- **FarmingSystem.js** (Lines 229-258):
  - `waterCrop(x, y, z)` - Main watering logic
  - Checks crop validity, watering status, triggers animation
  - Integration with AnimationSystem

- **VoxelWorld.js**:
  - Lines 10094-10116: Watering can auto-work detection (right-click handler)
  - Line 6151: Added `watering_can` to validItems for `giveItem()`
  - Debug logs for watering can detection and results

- **ToolBenchSystem.js** (Lines 158-170):
  - Watering can recipe: 3 iron + 1 stick
  - Category: farming
  - Description: "Water crops for 2x faster growth. Right-click farmland."

- **EnhancedGraphics.js** (Lines 69-70):
  - Texture mappings for `watering_can` and `crafted_watering_can`

**Bug Fixes:**

1. **`crafted_hoe` Not Working** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: `giveItem('crafted_hoe')` didn't work for tilling
   - **Cause**: `hasEquippedTool('hoe')` only checked for exact match 'hoe'
   - **Fix**: Updated to check both base and crafted versions (VoxelWorld.js:129-135)
   ```javascript
   this.hasEquippedTool = (toolType) => {
       const craftedName = `crafted_${toolType}`;
       return activeTools.some(tool =>
           tool.itemType === toolType || tool.itemType === craftedName
       );
   };
   ```

2. **Watering Can Not Auto-Working** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Watering can only worked when selected in hotbar
   - **Cause**: Handler was inside `if (selectedBlock && selectedSlot.quantity > 0)` block
   - **Fix**: Moved watering detection outside, added auto-work like hoe (VoxelWorld.js:10094-10116)

3. **Missing `isWatered()` Method** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: `TypeError: this.cropGrowthManager.isWatered is not a function`
   - **Cause**: Method didn't exist in CropGrowthManager
   - **Fix**: Added `isWatered()` method with expiration check (CropGrowthManager.js:65-81)

**User Experience:**

```
1. Craft watering can at ToolBench (3 iron + 1 stick)
2. Place in playerbar (any slot)
3. Plant crops (wheat, carrot, pumpkin, berry)
4. Right-click crop ‚Üí üíß Water particles fall, "Crop watered!" notification
5. Crop grows 2x faster (5 days per stage instead of 10)
6. Try watering again ‚Üí "Crop is already watered!"
7. After 1 in-game day ‚Üí Watering expires, can water again
```

### üîì UI Testing Tools & Debug Commands

**Overview:**
Added `unlockUI()` function that auto-unlocks hotbar, backpack, companion, and workbench when using `giveItem()`. No more need for `nuclearReset()` or finding the backpack during testing!

**Core Features:**

1. **`unlockUI()` Function** (VoxelWorld.js:6098-6124):
   - Unlocks all UI elements: hotbar, backpack, companion portrait, workbench
   - Calls same functions as natural backpack discovery:
     - `generateBackpackLoot()` - Random starting items
     - `showHotbarTutorial()` - Display hotbar
     - `showToolButtons()` - Workbench/ToolBench buttons
     - `companionPortrait.create()` - Companion UI
     - `showJournalTutorial()` - Map tutorial
   - Status notification: "üîì Debug: UI unlocked! All systems ready."

2. **Auto-Unlock in `giveItem()`** (VoxelWorld.js:6130-6133):
   - Automatically checks if UI is unlocked before giving items
   - If `!this.hasBackpack`, calls `unlockUI()` first
   - Makes testing seamless - no manual setup needed

3. **Global Commands** (VoxelWorld.js:6127):
   - `window.unlockUI()` - Manually unlock UI anytime
   - `giveItem('item_name')` - Give item + auto-unlock UI
   - Logged to console on game start (VoxelWorld.js:6091)

**Implementation Files:**

- **VoxelWorld.js**:
  - Lines 6098-6124: `unlockUI()` - Main unlock function
  - Line 6127: Global command registration
  - Lines 6130-6133: Auto-unlock check in `giveItem()`
  - Line 6091: Console log for available utility

- **CLAUDE.md** (Lines 308-311):
  - Added UI Testing section to Debug Commands
  - Examples: `unlockUI()`, `giveItem('hoe')`, `giveItem('crafted_watering_can')`

**User Experience:**

```
BEFORE:
giveItem('crafted_watering_can')
‚ùå Can't see item - UI locked, need to find backpack or nuclearReset()

AFTER:
giveItem('crafted_watering_can')
‚úÖ UI auto-unlocks, item added to inventory, ready to use immediately!
```

## 2025-10-10 (Evening) - üî• Campfire Respawn System & Battle Fixes

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ**

### üî• Campfire Respawn System

**Overview:**
Implemented campfire-based respawn system where crafted pyramids named "Campfire" become save points. Players respawn at the last placed campfire when defeated in battle.

**Core Features:**

1. **Pyramid ‚Üí Campfire Crafting**:
   - Craft any wood pyramid in ShapeForge
   - Naming modal automatically suggests "Campfire" as default name
   - Gold hint box displays: "üí° Tip: Name it 'Campfire' to set as your respawn point when placed!"
   - System automatically appends "_campfire" suffix to itemId when named "Campfire"

2. **Campfire Detection**:
   - Pattern matching detects: `'campfire'`, `'Campfire'`, or any itemId containing `'_campfire'`
   - Works with crafted items: `crafted_oak_wood_pyramid_0.8x0.8x0.6_campfire`
   - Tracks last placed campfire coordinates + timestamp

3. **Save System Integration**:
   - Placing campfire saves respawn point to localStorage
   - Bottom-left status notification: "üî• Game saved! Respawn point updated!"
   - Status icon changes to üî• for 3 seconds, then reverts to üéÆ
   - Persists across game sessions

4. **Respawn Mechanics**:
   - Player defeated in battle ‚Üí respawn at campfire (or world spawn if no campfire)
   - Spawn offset: +2 blocks X/Z, +1 block Y (avoids clipping into campfire)
   - Player respawns with 1 heart, companion healed to full HP
   - Hearts HUD persists when damaged, auto-hides when fully healed

5. **Cleanup Functions Updated**:
   - `clearCaches()` - Now clears campfire data
   - `clearAllData()` - Now clears campfire data
   - `nuclearClear()` - Full reset including campfire saves

**Implementation Files:**

- **VoxelWorld.js**:
  - Line 77: Added `respawnCampfire` property
  - Line 78: Added `spawnPosition` default
  - Lines 613-642: Campfire detection with pattern matching
  - Lines 756-771: `saveRespawnPoint()` and `loadRespawnPoint()` methods
  - Updated cleanup functions to remove campfire data

- **WorkbenchSystem.js**:
  - Lines 1758-1790: Pyramid detection + "Campfire" default name + hint UI
  - Lines 2083-2088: Automatic "_campfire" suffix appending
  - Campfire hint: Orange background with gold text

- **BattleArena.js**:
  - Lines 693-706: Campfire respawn logic with fallback to world spawn
  - Lines 685-688: Immediate movement flag clearing on respawn
  - Context-aware dialogue mentions campfire if present

**User Experience:**

```
1. Craft wood pyramid in ShapeForge
2. Name it "Campfire" (pre-filled, hint shown)
3. Place campfire in world
4. Status shows: "üî• Game saved! Respawn point updated!"
5. Die in battle
6. Respawn at campfire with 1 heart
7. Movement works immediately, no restrictions
```

---

### ‚öîÔ∏è Battle System Fixes

**Critical Bug Fixes:**

1. **Movement Restriction After Respawn** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Player couldn't move after respawning from battle defeat
   - **Cause**: Race condition - `cleanup()` had 500ms setTimeout but respawn was immediate
   - **Fix**: Added immediate movement flag clearing before cleanup (BattleArena.js:685-688)
   ```javascript
   this.voxelWorld.movementEnabled = true;
   this.voxelWorld.inBattleArena = false;
   this.voxelWorld.keys = {}; // Clear stuck keys
   ```

2. **CombatantSprite Null Position Error** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'position')` at line 407
   - **Cause**: Animation intervals tried to access sprite.position after sprite was destroyed
   - **Fix**: Added null safety checks to 3 animation methods (CombatantSprite.js):
     - `playVictory()` - Lines 402-430
     - `playFallback()` - Lines 344-382
     - `playDefeat()` - Lines 450-472
   - Each method now checks `if (!this.sprite)` before and during animations

3. **Notification System Fix** ‚úÖ
   - **Issue**: Campfire notification used wrong method
   - **Fix**: Now directly manipulates HTML status elements:
     - `status-icon` ‚Üí üî•
     - `status-text` ‚Üí "Game saved! Respawn point updated!"
     - Auto-resets after 3 seconds

**Files Modified:**
- `src/BattleArena.js` - Respawn movement fix
- `src/CombatantSprite.js` - Animation safety checks
- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Campfire detection + notification

### üéÉ Future Feature Note: Pumpkin Ghost Attraction

**Concept**: Jack-o'-lantern ghost magnet mechanic

**Behavior**:
1. **Holding Pumpkin**: When player has pumpkin selected in hotbar:
   - Nearby ghosts (ruin ghosts, forest ghosts) detect pumpkin
   - Ghosts follow player while pumpkin is held
   - Peaceful following behavior (no attacks)

2. **Placing Pumpkin**: When pumpkin placed as block:
   - Following ghosts orbit around placed pumpkin
   - Ghosts circle/float near pumpkin location
   - Creates spooky ambient decoration

3. **Removing Pumpkin**: When pumpkin picked up/destroyed:
   - Ghosts lose attraction and wander away
   - Return to original spawn zones
   - Resume normal ghost behavior

**Technical Notes**:
- Add proximity detection for ghosts (scan radius ~20 blocks)
- Check player's selected hotbar slot for pumpkin itemId
- Ghost follow AI: lerp toward player position when pumpkin held
- Ghost orbit AI: circle animation around placed pumpkin block
- Reset ghost behavior on pumpkin removal

**Similar Systems**:
- Minecraft: Pigs/cows follow wheat
- Terraria: Town NPCs move to houses
- Stardew Valley: Animals follow when you hold hay

**Files to Modify**:
- `VoxelWorld.js` - Hotbar pumpkin detection
- Ghost billboard system - Follow/orbit behavior
- Block placement/removal handlers

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ**

### üåæ Farming System - Stardew Valley-Inspired Agriculture

**Overview:**
Implemented a complete farming system with soil tilling, seed planting, multi-stage crop growth, and harvesting mechanics. Fully integrated with day/night cycle and inventory systems.

**Core Features:**

1. **Hoe Tool (Equipment Slot)**:
   - Crafted at ToolBench: 2 wood + 1 stick = hoe
   - Works from player bar (equipment slots) - "always on" like machete
   - Left-click grass/dirt ‚Üí instant till (no harvest delay)
   - Converts grass/dirt ‚Üí tilled_soil blocks
   - Non-placeable tool (can't be placed as block)
   - Temporary icon: stick.png (awaiting hoe.png asset)

**Bug Fixes:**

1. **getBlock() Return Type** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: getBlock() returns object `{type: "grass", mesh: {...}}` not string
   - Solution: Extract `.type` property in all farming checks
   - Affected: tillSoil(), plantSeed(), left-click handler

2. **Inventory Method Names** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: FarmingSystem used wrong methods (inventorySystem.removeItem)
   - Solution: Use VoxelWorld.addToInventory() and removeFromInventory()
   - Affected: plantSeed() and harvestCrop()

3. **Notification Function** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: showNotification() doesn't exist

   - Solution: Removed duplicate quantity-- in VoxelWorld right-click

5. **Hoe Equipment Slot** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: Hoe not recognized as equipment slot tool
   - Solution: Added 'hoe' to HotbarSystem.isToolItem() identifiers

6. **Seeds Placeable as Blocks** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: Seeds could be placed like stone blocks
   - Solution: Added all seeds/crops to nonPlaceableItems list

7. **Tilled Soil Texture Loading** ‚úÖ
   - Fixed: tilled_soil-all.png not loading (not in multiFaceBlocks)
   - Solution: Added 'tilled_soil' to multiFaceBlocks array

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
giveItem('hoe')              // Get hoe tool
giveItem('wheat_seeds', 10)  // Get 10 wheat seeds
giveItem('carrot_seeds', 10) // Get 10 carrot seeds
listItems()                  // Shows farming category
```

**Controls:**
- **Hoe (in player bar)** + Left-click grass/dirt = Till soil
- **Seeds (in hotbar)** + Right-click tilled soil = Plant seeds
- Left-click mature crop = Harvest

**Future Enhancements:**
- 3D crop models (instead of block stages)
- Billboard sprite crops (Minecraft-style)
- Water bucket for watering crops
- More crop varieties
- Seasonal crops

**Future Farming Enhancements (Next Session):**

üåæ **High Priority (Core Mechanics):**
1. **Watering System** - CropGrowthManager has 2x growth logic ready, needs:
   - Water bucket tool (craft from iron?)
   - Right-click tilled soil to water
   - Visual indicator (darker/wetter soil texture or particle effect)
   - Water state persists in crop save data

2. **Visual Improvements**:
   - Billboard sprites for crops (Minecraft-style X-shaped plants)
   - Or simple 3D models instead of solid block stages
   - Animated growth transitions
   - Crop sway animation in wind

üå± **Medium Priority (Expansion):**
3. **More Crop Varieties**: Tomatoes, corn, potatoes, onions, beets
4. **Fertilizer System**: Compost from dead leaves/grass ‚Üí boost growth speed or quality
5. **Crop Quality Tiers**: Perfect/Good/Normal based on watering consistency
6. **Cooking Station**: Upgrade from campfire, combine crops into meals with buffs

üéÉ **Optional (Advanced Features):**
7. **Scarecrows**: Decorative + future pest/bird protection mechanic
8. **Greenhouse Building**: Multi-block structure for year-round farming
9. **Seasonal Crops**: Winter/summer exclusives tied to day/night cycle seasons
10. **Irrigation System**: Sprinklers or water channels for auto-watering

## 2025-10-10 Late Night - Combat Arena Ground Positioning Fix

**Status: FIXED ‚úÖ**

### ‚öîÔ∏è Combat Arena Positioning & Sprite Clipping

**Overview:**
Fixed combat arena and combatant sprite positioning to properly align with player's ground level. Identified near-plane clipping issue when sprites get close to camera.

**Fixes Applied:**

1. **Arena Ground Level Calculation** (BattleArena.js:93-95):
   - **Problem**: Arena and combatants were floating in air (player.position.y is at eye level, not feet)
   - **First Attempt**: Subtracted 1.6 blocks (full player height) - went too far underground
   - **Final Fix**: Subtract 0.80 blocks for proper ground-level positioning
   ```javascript
   const groundOffset = 0.80; // Adjust slightly down to raise combatants a bit
   const footY = playerPos.y - groundOffset;
   ```

2. **Arena Wall Height Reduction** (BattleArena.js:76):
   - Reduced from 2.5 blocks to 0.5 blocks for subtle border
   - Creates attention-grabbing boundary without blocking view
   - Arena square stays at ground level while combatants positioned correctly

3. **Companion Portrait HP Sync** (CombatantSprite.js:192-195, BattleArena.js:51):
   - Added VoxelWorld reference to companion sprite
   - HP updates during combat now sync to companion portrait UI
   - Real-time HP bar updates on portrait during battles

**Known Issue (Not Yet Fixed):**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Near-Plane Clipping**: When combatants move close to camera during attack animations, parts of their sprites get cut off (pass through camera's near clipping plane).

**Planned Fix:**
Adjust camera near plane in VoxelWorld.js from default (~0.1 or 1.0) to smaller value like 0.01:
```javascript
this.camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    75,                          // FOV
    window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,  // Aspect
    0.01,                        // Near plane (smaller = less clipping)
    1000                         // Far plane
);
```

**Console Log Cleanup** (VoxelWorld.js:7055, ChunkLODManager.js:201, 236):
- Commented out fog update debug logs
- Commented out LOD chunk loading logs
- Cleaner console output during battles

**Files Modified:**
- `src/BattleArena.js` (lines 76, 93-95, 51) - Ground positioning and wall height
- `src/CombatantSprite.js` (lines 11, 16, 192-195) - HP sync with portrait
- `src/VoxelWorld.js` (line 7055) - Fog log cleanup
- `src/rendering/ChunkLODManager.js` (lines 201, 236) - LOD log cleanup

## 2025-10-09 - Christmas System & Advanced Battle System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ**

### üéÑ ChristmasSystem.js - Self-Contained Holiday Event System

**Overview:**
Created a comprehensive Christmas event system with Douglas Fir trees, gift-wrapped loot blocks, and snow mechanics that activate during Dec 24-25.

**Core Features:**
1. **Regular Douglas Fir Trees** (Year-round, 1% spawn):
   - 7x7 ‚Üí 5x5 ‚Üí 3x3 ‚Üí 1 block tall cone shape
   - Uses douglas_fir wood and douglas_fir-leaves blocks
   - 6-block tree spacing (similar to pine)
   - Generated by TreeWorker in background

2. **Mega Douglas Fir** (Dec 24-25 ONLY, 0.1% spawn):
   - Massive 11x11 ‚Üí 9x9 ‚Üí 7x7 ‚Üí 5x5 ‚Üí 3x3 ‚Üí 1 cone (30-40 blocks tall!)
   - Gold star block on top (harvestable keepsake)
   - 5-10 gift-wrapped blocks randomly placed in canopy
   - 15x15 snow circle converts grass/dirt/stone/sand to snow
   - 3-day snow melt timer after Dec 26

3. **Gift-Wrapped Blocks**:
   - Random ToolBench item drops when harvested
   - Loot pool: crafted_combat_sword, crafted_mining_pick, crafted_stone_hammer, crafted_magic_amulet, crafted_compass, crafted_compass_upgrade, crafted_speed_boots, crafted_grappling_hook, crafted_machete
   - Uses "crafted_" prefix for proper inventory integration

4. **Snow Mechanics**:
   - Snow circles tracked with melt timers
   - 3 in-game days (10 min/day = 30 minutes real time)
   - Reverts snow back to original block types
   - Only melts if still snow (respects player modifications)

5. **Companion Proximity Alerts**:
   - 20 chunk distance (~160 blocks): "There's something magical in the air..."
   - 5 chunk distance (~40 blocks): "That massive tree... it's magnificent!"
   - Uses ChatOverlay with active companion
   - 60-second cooldown per alert type

### ‚öîÔ∏è Advanced 3D Battle System - Player Movement & Animation Patterns

**Overview:**
Completely overhauled the battle system with 6 dynamic animation patterns, arena boundaries, player movement, item targeting, and context-aware sprite animations. Players can now move within an 8x8 arena, support their companion with items, and watch battles unfold with varied attack patterns.

**Core Features:**

1. **6 Battle Animation Patterns** (Random selection per battle):
   - **Semi-Orbit with Facing**: Opposite sides with gentle side-to-side sway
   - **Radial Burst Arena**: Dash toward center to attack, retreat to edges
   - **Circle Strafe**: Orbit in opposite directions (stalking/predator feel)
   - **Figure-8 Pattern**: Parametric lemniscate paths that intersect at center
   - **Pendulum Swing**: Swing back/forth like pendulums, opposite phases
   - **Spiral In/Out**: Spiral toward center, attack, spiral back out

2. **8x8 Arena Boundary System**:
   - Visual walls (2.5 blocks tall, semi-transparent bronze/gold with glow)
   - Arena floor marker (subtle glowing circle on ground)
   - Invisible boundary prevents player from leaving
   - Auto-cleanup when battle ends (walls and floor removed)

3. **Player Movement During Battle**:
   - Full movement enabled (WASD controls active)
   - Restricted to 8x8 block area around battle center
   - Movement bounds checked on both free movement and wall-sliding
   - Camera controls remain active (look around freely)
   - Flag system: `voxelWorld.inBattleArena = true/false`

4. **Item Targeting System** (Support Your Companion):
   - Raycaster targeting: aim reticle at companion sprite
   - `isTargetingCompanion()`: Checks if player is aiming correctly
   - `useItemOnCompanion(itemType, amount)`: Apply potions/buffs
   - Health potions restore HP with green flash visual feedback
   - Items only work when targeting companion (strategic challenge)

5. **Enhanced Combat Animations**:
   - **Dodge System**: Speed-based dodge chance (up to 30% for fast companions)
   - **Critical Hits**: Natural 20 doubles damage, triggers special animation
   - **Heavy Damage**: 50%+ HP loss triggers fallback + knockback
   - **Context-Aware Sprites**: Swap between ready/attack/dodge/fallback poses

6. **CombatantSprite Enhancements**:
   - `showDodgePose()`: Quick sidestep animation when dodging
   - `showFallbackPose()`: Knockback + shake for critical damage
   - `playDodge()`: Sidestep dash with auto-return (300ms)
   - `playFallback()`: Knockback + screen shake (500ms duration)

- Dodge/critical/fallback animations add visual depth and tactical feedback
- Arena walls provide clear visual boundaries without blocking camera view
- Fresh CanvasTexture creation for each pattern prevents memory leaks

**Visual Flow:**
1. Battle starts ‚Üí Random pattern selected
2. Arena walls/floor spawn (8x8 glowing boundary)
3. Player can move within arena, camera rotates freely
4. Combatants follow selected pattern (circling/bursting/spiraling/etc.)
5. Attack triggers lunge ‚Üí damage calculation ‚Üí dodge/critical/fallback animations
6. Player aims at companion ‚Üí uses potion ‚Üí green flash + HP restored
7. Victory/defeat ‚Üí Arena cleanup ‚Üí Movement unrestricted

## 2025-10-09 - Tree Block Type Registry Fix (CRITICAL)

**Status: FIXED ‚úÖ**

### üêõ Critical Bug: Trees Rendering as Stone Blocks

**Overview:**
Fixed a critical bug where all tree trunks and leaves were rendering/harvesting as stone blocks instead of wood. The issue existed since biome-specific trees were first added and was caused by missing block type definitions in the BlockTypes registry.

**The Problem:**
1. **Missing Block Types**: Tree generation code used block types like `'oak_wood-leaves'`, `'pine_wood-leaves'`, `'birch_wood-leaves'`, `'palm_wood-leaves'`, and `'dead_wood-leaves'`
2. **Registry Mismatch**: Only trunk types (`oak_wood`, `pine_wood`, `birch_wood`, `palm_wood`) were defined in `blockTypes` object - leaf types were missing
3. **Undefined Materials**: When `addBlock()` tried to access `this.materials['oak_wood-leaves']`, it returned `undefined`
4. **Fallback Rendering**: Trees rendered with broken/fallback materials, appearing as stone blocks
5. **Wrong Harvesting**: Harvesting tree trunks yielded stone/coal instead of wood

**The Fix:**

Added missing block type definitions in `src/VoxelWorld.js:6482-6496`:

```javascript
// NEW: Dead wood trunk type
dead_wood: { color: 0x3C3C3C, texture: 'dead_wood' },

// Tree-specific leaf types (matching tree generation function naming)
'oak_wood-leaves': { color: 0x228B22, texture: 'oak_wood-leaves' },   // Oak tree leaves
'pine_wood-leaves': { color: 0x006400, texture: 'pine_wood-leaves' }, // Pine needles
'palm_wood-leaves': { color: 0x9ACD32, texture: 'palm_wood-leaves' }, // Palm fronds
'birch_wood-leaves': { color: 0x90EE90, texture: 'birch_wood-leaves' }, // Birch leaves
'dead_wood-leaves': { color: 0x4A4A4A, texture: 'dead_wood-leaves' }, // Dead leaves (gray-brown)
```

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Tree trunks now render as brown wood (oak, pine, palm, birch variants)
- ‚úÖ Tree leaves render with proper green colors
- ‚úÖ Dead trees render with gray trunks and leaves
- ‚úÖ Harvesting trees yields wood blocks (with timber falling animation)
- ‚úÖ No more stone/coal from tree trunks

**Root Cause Analysis:**
This bug existed since the introduction of biome-specific trees because the hyphenated leaf block types (`oak_wood-leaves`, etc.) were never added to the BlockTypes registry. The tree generation functions (lines 7606-7815) were using these types, but the materials system couldn't find them, causing a silent failure that defaulted to stone rendering.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/VoxelWorld.js:6482-6496` - Added 6 missing block type definitions

## 2025-10-09 - TreeWorker Performance & Memory Leak Fixes

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üå≤ TreeWorker - Dedicated Worker for Tree Generation

**Overview:**
Moved tree generation off main thread to eliminate stuttering during chunk loading. Created TreeWorker to handle all tree placement logic in parallel with terrain generation, achieving smooth 60fps chunk streaming.

**Core Features:**
1. **TreeWorker Pipeline**: ChunkWorker ‚Üí TreeWorker ‚Üí Main Thread orchestration
2. **50% Tree Density Reduction**: Improved performance and gameplay balance (treeChance * 0.50)
3. **Ancient/Mega Tree Rarity**: 5% chunk-exclusive spawn (one special tree per chunk, no other trees)
   - 50/50 split: Regular ancient (3x3 trunk) vs Mega ancient (20-32 blocks tall)
   - Spawn at chunk center for landmark visibility
4. **LOD Tree System**: Simple colored blocks in distant chunks (brown trunk + green canopy)
5. **LOD Visual Distance**: Reduced from 3 ‚Üí 2 chunks for fog compatibility and performance

**Implementation:**

- `src/workers/TreeWorker.js` (NEW - 376 lines)
  - Line 19-39: Message handling for INIT, GENERATE_TREES, GENERATE_LOD_TREES, CLEAR_CACHE
  - Line 56-176: `generateTreesForChunk()` with ancient chunk exclusivity (5% chance)
  - Line 62-96: Ancient chunk logic - single tree at chunk center
  - Line 98-162: Normal chunk logic - noise-based tree placement with spacing
  - Line 208-222: `shouldGenerateTree()` - 50% density reduction (0.50 multiplier)
  - Line 224-249: `hasNearbyTree()` - 3-block minimum spacing between trees
  - Line 291-375: `generateLODTreesForChunk()` - Simple colored blocks for LOD

- `src/worldgen/WorkerManager.js` - TreeWorker orchestration
  - Line 34-37: TreeWorker initialization and message handling
  - Line 98-129: `initializeTreeWorker()` - Create and configure TreeWorker
  - Line 193-232: `handleChunkReady()` - Forward heightMap/waterMap to TreeWorker
  - Line 234-264: `handleTreeWorkerMessage()` - Process TREES_READY responses
  - Line 266-291: `handleTreesReady()` - Merge trees data with chunk data for main thread

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Tree rendering integration
  - Line 7367-7399: `handleWorkerChunkData()` - Immediate tree rendering (no setTimeout delay)
  - Line 7370-7373: Auto-unload LOD chunk when full chunk loads (prevent double rendering)
  - Line 7377-7399: Process trees array from TreeWorker, render ancient/mega/regular trees

- `src/workers/ChunkWorker.js` - LOD tree generation
  - Line 296-357: `generateLODChunk()` with simple LOD trees (brown trunk + 3x3 green canopy)
  - Line 303-305: 50% tree density reduction matching TreeWorker

- `src/rendering/ChunkLODManager.js` - LOD system tuning
  - Line 28: `visualDistance = 2` (reduced from 3 for fog compatibility)
  - Reduces LOD chunks by 33%, better performance and less pop-in

**Performance Impact:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminated main thread blocking during tree generation
- ‚úÖ 50% fewer trees = 50% less geometry to render
- ‚úÖ Ancient/mega trees now rare (5% of chunks) instead of 20% of all trees
- ‚úÖ 33% fewer LOD chunks rendered (visualDistance 3 ‚Üí 2)
- ‚úÖ Memory usage stable at ~4.3GB (Code 1.9GB + Browser 1.8GB)
- ‚úÖ Smooth 60fps chunk loading with no stuttering

**Known Visual Mismatch:**
‚ö†Ô∏è LOD trees in distant chunks do NOT match actual trees when full chunks load. This is expected behavior:
- LOD uses simplified noise for tree placement (ChunkWorker)
- Full chunks use TreeWorker with spacing logic and ancient chunk exclusivity
- Result: Trees "change position" when transitioning from LOD ‚Üí full detail

### üóëÔ∏è Memory Leak Fixes

**Billboard Disposal** (VoxelWorld.js):
- Line ~1186: `removeBlock()` now properly disposes billboard geometry, material, and textures
- Line ~1897: `refreshAllBillboards()` cleanup improved

**Falling Tree Block Disposal** (VoxelWorld.js):
- Line ~5014, 5125: `createFallingLeafBlock()` cleanup adds geometry/material disposal
- Line ~5214: `createFallingWoodBlock()` cleanup adds geometry/material disposal

**Result:** Memory usage dropped from 6.5GB ‚Üí 4.3GB, system stable during extended gameplay

## 2025-10-08 - Critical Memory Leak Fix (Fog System)

**Status: FIXED**

### üå´Ô∏è Fog Memory Leak & Optimization

**Overview:**
Fixed a critical memory leak in the fog system that was causing Gnome to crash and maxing out 8GB RAM. The fog system was creating new `THREE.Fog` objects every single frame (60+ times per second), leading to thousands of unreleased objects accumulating in memory.

**The Problem:**
1. **Duplicate Fog Creation**: Three separate locations were creating `new THREE.Fog()` objects:
   - `updateFog()` function (line 6902) - called every frame by day/night cycle
   - Day/night cycle update (lines 8471, 8476) - ran every frame
   - Render distance change handler (line 10547)
2. **Memory Leak**: Creating ~60 fog objects per second = 3,600 objects per minute
3. **No Garbage Collection**: THREE.Fog objects were never disposed, just orphaned
4. **Fog Not Visible**: `visualDist = 1` caused `fogStart = fogEnd = 16.0` (zero-width fog)

**The Fix:**
1. **Reuse One Fog Object** (VoxelWorld.js:6903-6911):
   - Create fog object ONCE on first call
   - Update properties (`color.setHex()`, `near`, `far`) instead of creating new objects
   - Prevents memory leak from object creation

2. **Consolidate to `updateFog()`** (VoxelWorld.js:8471-8474, 10538-10541):
   - Removed duplicate fog creation from day/night cycle
   - Removed duplicate fog creation from render distance handler
   - All fog updates now use centralized `updateFog()` method

3. **Fix Fog Visibility** (VoxelWorld.js:6896-6898):
   - Changed default `visualDist` from 1 to 3
   - Changed `fogStart` from `renderDistance + 1` to `renderDistance - 1`
   - Creates visible 32-block fog gradient instead of zero-width wall

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Memory Leak):
this.scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(color, fogStart, fogEnd); // Creates new object every frame

// AFTER (Reuses Object):
if (!this.scene.fog) {
    this.scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(color, fogStart, fogEnd); // Create ONCE
} else {
    this.scene.fog.color.setHex(color);  // Update existing
    this.scene.fog.near = fogStart;
    this.scene.fog.far = fogEnd;
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ No more fog-related memory leaks
- ‚úÖ Fog visible with proper gradient (start: 0, end: 32 blocks)
- ‚úÖ Day/night fog color changes work correctly
- ‚úÖ Dramatically reduced memory usage

**Known Memory Issues Still To Investigate:**
1. **Aggressive Tree Scanning**: Chunk unloading scans y=1 to y=65 for every column (4,160 checks per chunk)
   - May be scanning too frequently or inefficiently
   - Tree cache system may need optimization
2. **LOD Visual Chunks**: Visual chunks beyond render distance may accumulate
   - Need to verify proper disposal when player moves
3. **Billboard Sprites**: Backpack, shrub, ghost sprites may not be cleaning up properly
4. **Chunk Mesh Pool**: Need to verify BlockResourcePool is recycling geometries

**Files Modified:**
- `src/VoxelWorld.js` (lines 6884-6914, 8471-8474, 10538-10541)

**Testing:**
- Console log should show: `üå´Ô∏è Fog updated: SOFT (start: 0.0, end: 32.0, renderDist: 1, chunkSize: 8, visualDist: 3)`
- Fog should be visible as gradual fade from clear to opaque
- Memory usage should stabilize instead of growing continuously

## 2025-10-07 - Grappling Hook & Animation System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üï∏Ô∏è Grappling Hook with Trajectory Animation

**Overview:**
Implemented a fully functional grappling hook item that teleports the player with smooth bezier curve trajectory animation. This is the first feature in the new AnimationSystem.js, which will centralize all animations (explosions, particles, billboards, tree falling, etc.) to reduce VoxelWorld.js complexity.

**Core Features:**
1. **ToolBench Crafting**: Craft from 3 leaves + 1 feather, gives 10 charges
2. **Trajectory Animation**: Smooth bezier curve arc with apex calculation (like Spider-Man!)
3. **Visual Trajectory Line**: Light gray line shows flight path, fades out during animation
4. **Apex Calculation**: Arc height scales with distance (minimum 5 blocks, max distance * 0.3)
5. **Physics Integration**: Resets velocity during flight to prevent interference
6. **Icon System**: Enhanced graphics support with fuzzy matching for crafted items
7. **Non-Placeable**: Properly prevents grappling hook from being placed as block

**Implementation:**

- `src/AnimationSystem.js` (NEW - 177 lines) - Centralized animation management
  - `update()` - Frame-by-frame animation updates integrated with game loop
  - `animateGrapplingHook()` - Bezier curve trajectory with apex calculation
  - Quadratic Bezier formula: B(t) = (1-t)¬≤ * P0 + 2(1-t)t * P1 + t¬≤ * P2
  - Trajectory line with 30 segments, fades from opacity 0.8 ‚Üí 0
  - Auto-cleanup: removes line from scene, disposes geometry/material
  - Placeholder methods for future: explosions, billboards, particles, tree falling

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Integration and fixes
  - Line 8-9: Import AnimationSystem
  - Line 172: Initialize `this.animationSystem = new AnimationSystem(this)`
  - Line 9008-9011: Update animation system in game loop
  - Line 9668-9719: Grappling hook with trajectory animation (instant teleport commented as backup)
  - Line 2129-2145: ToolBench tools check BEFORE crafted_ parsing to prevent Material Icons fallback
  - Line 9708-9710: Non-placeable items includes all grapple variants

- `src/ToolBenchSystem.js` - Charges system
  - Line 900: `createConsumable()` now gives `blueprint.charges` quantity (10 for grappling hook)
  - Line 549, 681: Pass context to `getItemIcon()` for proper enhanced graphics display

- `src/EnhancedGraphics.js` - Icon system improvements
  - Line 47-52: Texture aliases map grappling_hook/crafted_grappling_hook ‚Üí grapple.png
  - Line 653-668: Fuzzy matching - if exact lookup fails, check if loaded tools contain lookup key

**Technical Details:**
- **Animation Duration**: 0.8 seconds (configurable)
- **Bezier Curve**: Quadratic (3 control points: start, apex, end)
- **Apex Formula**: `max(max(startY, endY) + 5, max(startY, endY) + distance * 0.3)`
- **Line Rendering**: THREE.Line with 30 BufferGeometry points
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of geometry/material on animation complete

**Fixes Along the Way:**
- Fixed player.velocity NaN bug (was setting object instead of number)
- Fixed crafted items showing Material Icons instead of enhanced graphics
- Added Math.floor() to prevent float coordinate bugs
- Fixed duplicate `if` statement causing syntax error

**Next Steps (TODO):**
- Extract explosion animation ‚Üí `animateExplosion()`
- Extract billboard floats ‚Üí `animateBillboard()`
- Extract particle effects ‚Üí `animateParticles()`
- Extract tree falling ‚Üí `animateTreeFall()` (note: uses Cannon.js physics)
- Optional: Camera tilt based on trajectory velocity vector

## 2025-10-06 Late Night - 3D Arena Battle System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### ‚öîÔ∏è Revolutionary 3D Combat System

**Overview:**
Replaced UI overlay battles with real-time 3D arena combat in the voxel world. Companions and enemies appear as 3D billboards sprites that circle each other, attack, and react to damage. This creates a unique hybrid of Minecraft's voxel world + Pokemon's creature battles + real-time 3D animations.

**Core Features:**
1. **3D Arena Combat**: Battles take place 4 blocks ahead of player in the voxel world
2. **Circling Animation**: Combatants orbit around arena center at 2-block radius
3. **Dynamic Sprite Poses**: Swap between `_ready_pose_enhanced.png` and `_attack_pose_enhanced.png`
4. **HP Bars**: Billboard sprites with color-coded health (green/yellow/red) above combatants
5. **Attack Animations**: Lunge forward, flash damage on hit, smooth lerp movement
6. **Context-Aware Victory Dialogue**: Companion comments based on remaining HP (95%+, 50%+, 25%+, <25%)
7. **Loot Integration**: Victory dialogue shows drops, adds to inventory on continue
8. **Free Camera**: Player can look around during combat but movement is disabled
9. **Turn-Based Logic**: Speed stat + d6 initiative, d20 + attack vs defense, d6 damage rolls

**Implementation:**

- `src/CombatantSprite.js` (NEW - 327 lines) - 3D sprite wrapper with HP bars, animations
  - `createSprite()` - 2-block tall sprites with ready pose
  - `createHPBar()` - Canvas-based HP bars with name/HP text
  - `showAttackPose()` / `showReadyPose()` - Texture swapping for animations
  - `flashDamage()` - Red flash on hit
  - `playVictory()` / `playDefeat()` - End-of-battle animations
  - `update()` - Smooth lerp movement and HP bar following

- `src/BattleArena.js` (NEW - 438 lines) - Full 3D arena orchestrator
  - `startBattle()` - Initialize arena 4 blocks ahead in player's facing direction
  - `getCirclePosition()` - Calculate positions on circular orbit
  - `buildTurnQueue()` - Speed-based initiative system
  - `updateCircling()` - Continuous rotation around arena center
  - `executeTurn()` - Attack animations with lunge forward
  - `resolveCombat()` - Hit/miss calculation, damage application
  - `showVictoryDialogue()` - HP-based contextual messages
  - `addLootToInventory()` - Integration with inventory system
  - `cleanup()` - Re-enable movement, restore pointer lock

- `src/BattleSystem.js` - Redirect to BattleArena instead of UI overlay
  - Line 142-149: Call `voxelWorld.battleArena.startBattle()` instead of creating UI

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Integration with main game loop
  - Line 13: Import BattleArena
  - Line 166: `this.battleArena = new BattleArena(this)`
  - Line 66: `this.movementEnabled = true` - Separate flag for movement vs camera
  - Line 9044-9046: Update battle arena in animation loop
  - Line 9063-9067: Skip movement but allow camera when `movementEnabled = false`
  - Line 11021-11051: `testCombat(enemyId)` debug method

- `src/App.js` - Expose debug command
  - Line 59-60: Global `window.testCombat()` function

- `src/AngryGhostSystem.js` - Direct PNG loading for angry ghosts
  - Line 61-89: Load `angry_ghost_ready_pose_enhanced.png` directly, no emoji fallback

- `src/EnhancedGraphics.js` - Support entities with only pose variants
  - `_loadEntityImages()` - Handle entities without base `.png` (only `_ready_pose_enhanced.png` and `_attack_pose_enhanced.png`)

**File Naming Convention:**
- `(enemyName)_ready_pose_enhanced.png` - Idle stance during combat
- `(enemyName)_attack_pose_enhanced.png` - Attack animation frame
- `(enemyName).jpeg` - Portrait for chat/UI only
- NO base `.png` files exist (e.g., no `angry_ghost.png`)

**Arena Positioning:**
- Arena spawns 4 blocks ahead in player's facing direction
- At player's Y level (feet position)
- 2-block radius orbit for combatants
- Combatants positioned at ground level (no elevation)
- HP bars float 1.5 blocks above sprite heads

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
testCombat()                // Spawn angry_ghost 4 blocks ahead
testCombat('angry_ghost')   // Same
testCombat('rat')           // Test with rat
testCombat('ghost')         // Test with ghost
```

**Technical Achievements:**
- Separate `movementEnabled` flag allows camera rotation during combat
- Clear input buffer prevents rushing forward after combat
- Texture swapping with proper disposal prevents memory leaks
- HP percentage-based dialogue adds personality
- Loot stored before sprite destruction prevents null references
- Billboard sprites always face camera for readability

**Visual Flow:**
1. Angry ghost triggers battle within 3-block range
2. Arena spawns 4 blocks ahead of player
3. Companion and enemy appear on opposite sides of circle
4. Combatants circle arena center while idle
5. Turn timer triggers attack (lunge forward, pose swap)
6. Damage flash, HP bar updates
7. Return to circling position
8. Repeat until knockout
9. Victory/defeat animations
10. Context-aware dialogue with loot info
11. Cleanup, restore controls

## 2025-10-05 Evening - Halloween Ghost Billboards & Pumpkin System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üéÉ Pumpkin Spawn System Fixes

**Bug Fixed:**
- **Noise Range Issue**: `multiOctaveNoise` returns `-1 to 1`, but pumpkin spawn check expected `0 to 1`
- **Old Rates**: 1.5% normal (actually 0.75%), 6% Halloween (actually 3%)
- **Fix**: Added noise normalization: `(pumpkinNoise + 1) / 2`
- **New Rates**: 3% normal, 15% on Halloween (Oct 31st)

**Code Location:**
- BiomeWorldGen.js:1256-1274 - Pumpkin spawn logic with fixed noise normalization

**Result:** Pumpkins are now **4x easier to find** (3% vs old buggy 0.75%)!

### üëª Halloween Ghost Billboard System

**Features:**
1. **Oct 31st Only**: Ghost billboards only spawn on October 31st (or with debug mode)
2. **One Per Chunk**: First pumpkin in each chunk gets a floating ghost above it
3. **Floating Animation**: Ghosts bob up and down slowly (floatSpeed: 1.5, floatAmount: 0.2)
4. **Auto-Remove**: When ANY pumpkin in the chunk is harvested, the ghost disappears
5. **Transparent PNG Support**: Uses THREE.SpriteMaterial with proper alpha transparency

**Implementation:**
- VoxelWorld.js:68-69 - Ghost billboard tracking Map and debug flag
- VoxelWorld.js:276-302 - Auto-spawn ghost on first pumpkin per chunk
- VoxelWorld.js:741-787 - `createGhostBillboard()` function
- VoxelWorld.js:813-827 - Ghost animation in `animateBillboards()`
- VoxelWorld.js:1114-1133 - Remove ghost when pumpkin harvested
- App.js:47-51 - Expose `window['voxelApp']` for debugging

**Debug Command:**
```javascript
window.voxelApp.debugHalloween = true;
window.voxelApp.clearCaches();
```

## 2025-10-05 - Ancient Trees & Pillar Trees

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üå≥ Ancient Tree System

**1. Regular Ancient Trees (15% spawn chance)**:
- **Thick 3x3 trunk** (9 blocks per layer vs normal 1x1)
- **Height**: 10-15 blocks tall (vs normal 5-8 blocks)
- **Large canopy**: 7x7 base for oak/birch/palm, conical radius-5 for pine
- **Biome-specific wood**: oak_wood, pine_wood, birch_wood, palm_wood
- **Massive loot**: ~117 wood blocks + 100+ leaf blocks when harvested
- **Code**: VoxelWorld.js:7609-7696

**2. Mega Ancient Trees (5% of ancient spawns = 1% overall)**:
- **Cone-shaped base**: 5x5 ‚Üí 3x3 ‚Üí 1x1 (8-13 blocks tall base)
- **Single trunk above**: 12-19 blocks tall
- **Total height**: 20-32 blocks (TWICE as tall as regular ancient!)
- **Massive canopy**: 11x11 base for oak/birch, radius-7 conical for pine
- **Visual landmark**: Visible from far away due to extreme height
- **Code**: VoxelWorld.js:7641-7676

**3. Spawn Logic** (VoxelWorld.js:7247-7254):
- 20% of all trees become ancient trees
- Top 25% of those (5% overall) become mega ancient
- Uses seeded noise for consistent placement
- Works with all biome tree types

### üèõÔ∏è Pillar Trees (Quirky Bug Turned Feature)

**Origin Story:**
- Stone pillars were generated under trees to prevent floating appearance
- Created weird elevated trees on stone columns
- Bug was so aesthetically interesting we kept it as an intentional feature!

**Detection System** (VoxelWorld.js:7852-7879):
- Detects isolated stone/iron/sand columns (‚â§2 solid neighbors)
- Preserves stone pillar instead of converting to dirt
- Creates unique ancient ruins aesthetic

### üèõÔ∏èüå¥ Mega Ancient Palm Trees (Another Happy Bug!)

**Origin Story:**
- Palm tree frond fix caused mega ancient palms to generate with inverted canopies
- Created bizarre alien monument structures in the desert
- Bug was so visually striking we kept it as an intentional feature!

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Massive 5x5 ‚Üí 3x3 ‚Üí 1x1 cone-shaped base
- 20-32 blocks tall
- Inverted tiered canopy (looks like alien architecture)
- Extremely rare (1% overall spawn rate)
- Desert biome landmarks

**Code Location:**
- VoxelWorld.js:7847-7890 - `generateMassiveCanopy()` creates the inverted effect
- **Intentionally NOT fixed** - unique aesthetic kept as feature

### üêõ Bug Fixes

**Inverted Palm Tree Bug** (VoxelWorld.js:7493):
- **Problem**: Extended fronds placed at `topY - 1` (hanging down into ground)
- **Fix**: Changed to `topY` for proper horizontal extension
- **Result**: Palm fronds now extend outward correctly

---

## 2025-10-05 - Tree Generation System Overhaul

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üêõ Six Critical Bugs Fixed

1. **Tree Density Multipliers Too Low** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1285-1295):
   - **Problem**: Multipliers were reduced from 2-12 down to 0.03-0.20, making trees virtually impossible to spawn
   - **Fix**: Doubled all multipliers back to proper values
     - Forest: 0.15 ‚Üí 16 (100x increase!)
     - Plains: 0.08 ‚Üí 20 (250x increase!)
     - Mountains: 0.12 ‚Üí 20
     - Desert: 0.03 ‚Üí 4
     - Tundra: 0.05 ‚Üí 6

2. **Tree Placement Height Search Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7204):
   - **Problem**: Surface search only checked up to y=15, but mountains go to y=30 (mega mountains y=60!)
   - **Fix**: Extended search range from y=15 ‚Üí y=64
   - Added check for 'air' blocks to properly detect surface

3. **Tree Save/Load Scan Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7718):
   - **Problem**: When unloading chunks, only scanned y=1-20 for tree trunks
   - **Fix**: Extended scan range from y=20 ‚Üí y=65 for tree trunk detection

4. **Chunk Unload Cleanup Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7764):
   - **Problem**: Only removed blocks up to y=20 when unloading chunks
   - **Fix**: Extended cleanup range from y=20 ‚Üí y=70 to remove ALL tree blocks

5. **Implemented Chunk-Based Tree Counter System** (BiomeWorldGen.js:33-41, 1023-1048, 1206-1248):
   - **Solution**: Added guaranteed minimum tree density system
   - **Guaranteed Tree Intervals**:
     - Forest: 1 tree per chunk (every chunk gets a tree!)
     - Plains: 1 tree per 3 chunks (~35 trees in 105-chunk walk)
     - Mountains: 1 tree per 2 chunks
     - Desert: 1 tree per 5 chunks (sparse)
     - Tundra: 1 tree per 4 chunks

6. **Fixed Variable Redeclaration Bug** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1299):
   - **Problem**: `centerX`, `centerZ`, `chunkBiome` declared twice in same scope
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration, reused variables from chunk counter logic

### üå≥ How the Dual Tree System Works

The new system uses TWO complementary methods:

1. **Noise-Based Trees** (Enhanced):
   - Random, natural placement using Perlin noise
   - 2x more likely to spawn than before
   - Creates organic, varied tree clusters
   - Respects biome-specific multipliers

2. **Guaranteed Trees** (New):
   - Forces 1 tree in chunk center every N chunks (based on biome)
   - Ensures minimum coverage even if noise check fails
   - Skips spacing restrictions to ensure placement
   - Tracks per-biome counters for proper distribution

## Earlier - Climate-Based Biome Generation & Terrain Height System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Climate-Based Biome Generation (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 712-780)

- **Temperature Map**: North-south gradient (-1 cold to +1 hot) with noise variation
- **Moisture Map**: Perlin noise for wet/dry regions (-1 dry to +1 wet)
- **Biome Selection Grid**: Climate zones determine biome placement
  - Cold + Dry = Tundra
  - Cold + Wet = Forest
  - Hot + Dry = Desert
  - Temperate + Wet = Forest
  - Temperate + Moderate = Plains/Mountain
- **Result**: Geographic biome placement - no more snow next to deserts!

### Increased Terrain Heights (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 39-122)

- **Plains**: y=3-6 (gentle rolling hills)
- **Forest**: y=4-10 (forested hills)
- **Desert**: y=3-8 (sand dunes for mining)
- **Mountains**: y=15-30 (tall mountains, previously y=8-20)
- **Tundra**: y=4-10 (icy hills)
- **Mega Mountains**: y=40-60 (rare super mountains in mountain biomes only)

**Super Mountain System** (lines 783-808):
- Noise-based modifier creates rare mega mountains (>0.7 threshold)
- Only applies to mountain biomes
- Smooth height transition from normal (y=30) to mega (y=60)
- Intentionally hollow for future multi-layer dungeon integration

### Water System Improvements (ChunkWorker.js lines 140-150)

- **Water Level**: Lowered from y=4 to y=3 to reduce floating water blocks
- **Water Fill**: Fills empty space from terrain height to y=3
- **Biome Integration**: Water level stays below biome ground level

### Spawn Point Safety System (VoxelWorld.js lines 6266-6324)

- **Height Search**: Changed from y=15 to y=64 to detect tall mountains
- **Solid Ground Check**: Requires 3+ solid blocks below spawn point
- **Clear Space Above**: 6-block vertical clearance for player
- **Result**: No more spawning inside hollow mountains!

### Noise Parameter Tuning (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 170-175)

- **Problem**: "Borg cube" artifacts - perfect 8√ó8 cubes at chunk boundaries
- **Iteration 1**: scale: 0.012 (original) - TOO sharp, created vertical cliffs
- **Iteration 2**: scale: 0.003 - TOO smooth, created flat plateaus
- **Final Balance**: scale: 0.008, octaves: 5, persistence: 0.55
- **Result**: Natural slopes with some remaining artifacts (user accepted)
