## 2025-10-09 - Christmas System & Advanced Battle System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✅**

### 🎄 ChristmasSystem.js - Self-Contained Holiday Event System

**Overview:**
Created a comprehensive Christmas event system with Douglas Fir trees, gift-wrapped loot blocks, and snow mechanics that activate during Dec 24-25.

**Core Features:**
1. **Regular Douglas Fir Trees** (Year-round, 1% spawn):
   - 7x7 → 5x5 → 3x3 → 1 block tall cone shape
   - Uses douglas_fir wood and douglas_fir-leaves blocks
   - 6-block tree spacing (similar to pine)
   - Generated by TreeWorker in background

2. **Mega Douglas Fir** (Dec 24-25 ONLY, 0.1% spawn):
   - Massive 11x11 → 9x9 → 7x7 → 5x5 → 3x3 → 1 cone (30-40 blocks tall!)
   - Gold star block on top (harvestable keepsake)
   - 5-10 gift-wrapped blocks randomly placed in canopy
   - 15x15 snow circle converts grass/dirt/stone/sand to snow
   - 3-day snow melt timer after Dec 26

3. **Gift-Wrapped Blocks**:
   - Random ToolBench item drops when harvested
   - Loot pool: crafted_combat_sword, crafted_mining_pick, crafted_stone_hammer, crafted_magic_amulet, crafted_compass, crafted_compass_upgrade, crafted_speed_boots, crafted_grappling_hook, crafted_machete
   - Uses "crafted_" prefix for proper inventory integration

4. **Snow Mechanics**:
   - Snow circles tracked with melt timers
   - 3 in-game days (10 min/day = 30 minutes real time)
   - Reverts snow back to original block types
   - Only melts if still snow (respects player modifications)

5. **Companion Proximity Alerts**:
   - 20 chunk distance (~160 blocks): "There's something magical in the air..."
   - 5 chunk distance (~40 blocks): "That massive tree... it's magnificent!"
   - Uses ChatOverlay with active companion
   - 60-second cooldown per alert type

### ⚔️ Advanced 3D Battle System - Player Movement & Animation Patterns

**Overview:**
Completely overhauled the battle system with 6 dynamic animation patterns, arena boundaries, player movement, item targeting, and context-aware sprite animations. Players can now move within an 8x8 arena, support their companion with items, and watch battles unfold with varied attack patterns.

**Core Features:**

1. **6 Battle Animation Patterns** (Random selection per battle):
   - **Semi-Orbit with Facing**: Opposite sides with gentle side-to-side sway
   - **Radial Burst Arena**: Dash toward center to attack, retreat to edges
   - **Circle Strafe**: Orbit in opposite directions (stalking/predator feel)
   - **Figure-8 Pattern**: Parametric lemniscate paths that intersect at center
   - **Pendulum Swing**: Swing back/forth like pendulums, opposite phases
   - **Spiral In/Out**: Spiral toward center, attack, spiral back out

2. **8x8 Arena Boundary System**:
   - Visual walls (2.5 blocks tall, semi-transparent bronze/gold with glow)
   - Arena floor marker (subtle glowing circle on ground)
   - Invisible boundary prevents player from leaving
   - Auto-cleanup when battle ends (walls and floor removed)

3. **Player Movement During Battle**:
   - Full movement enabled (WASD controls active)
   - Restricted to 8x8 block area around battle center
   - Movement bounds checked on both free movement and wall-sliding
   - Camera controls remain active (look around freely)
   - Flag system: `voxelWorld.inBattleArena = true/false`

4. **Item Targeting System** (Support Your Companion):
   - Raycaster targeting: aim reticle at companion sprite
   - `isTargetingCompanion()`: Checks if player is aiming correctly
   - `useItemOnCompanion(itemType, amount)`: Apply potions/buffs
   - Health potions restore HP with green flash visual feedback
   - Items only work when targeting companion (strategic challenge)

5. **Enhanced Combat Animations**:
   - **Dodge System**: Speed-based dodge chance (up to 30% for fast companions)
   - **Critical Hits**: Natural 20 doubles damage, triggers special animation
   - **Heavy Damage**: 50%+ HP loss triggers fallback + knockback
   - **Context-Aware Sprites**: Swap between ready/attack/dodge/fallback poses

6. **CombatantSprite Enhancements**:
   - `showDodgePose()`: Quick sidestep animation when dodging
   - `showFallbackPose()`: Knockback + shake for critical damage
   - `playDodge()`: Sidestep dash with auto-return (300ms)
   - `playFallback()`: Knockback + screen shake (500ms duration)
   - `flashDamageEnhanced(isCritical)`: Yellow flash for crits, red for normal

**Implementation:**

- `src/BattleAnimationPatterns.js` (NEW - 378 lines) - Pattern system
  - Base `BattlePattern` class with update/reset interface
  - 6 pattern classes: SemiOrbitPattern, RadialBurstPattern, CircleStrafePattern, Figure8Pattern, PendulumPattern, SpiralPattern
  - `getRandomBattlePattern()`: Factory for random selection
  - `getBattlePatternByName()`: Debug/testing pattern selection
  - Each pattern has configurable radius, speed, and unique motion physics

- `src/CombatantSprite.js` - Enhanced animations
  - Line 215-231: `showDodgePose()` - Dodge sprite swap
  - Line 237-252: `showFallbackPose()` - Heavy damage sprite swap
  - Line 314-331: `playDodge()` - Sidestep animation (0.5 block, 300ms)
  - Line 337-362: `playFallback()` - Knockback + shake (0.8 block, 500ms)
  - Line 368-389: `flashDamageEnhanced()` - Critical vs normal damage flash

- `src/BattleArena.js` - Arena system overhaul
  - Line 11: Import BattleAnimationPatterns
  - Line 26-28: Arena walls, floor, bounds tracking
  - Line 30-35: Player movement restriction bounds
  - Line 44: `currentPattern` - Active animation pattern
  - Line 57-58: `targetingRaycaster` - Item targeting system
  - Line 100-128: Store player position, calculate 8x8 bounds, select pattern

**Sprite Pose Variants Supported:**
- `sprite_ready` - Default idle pose (required)
- `sprite_attack` - Attack pose (required)
- `sprite_dodge` - Dodge pose (optional, falls back to ready)
- `sprite_fallback` - Heavy damage pose (optional, falls back to ready)

**Pattern Physics:**
- **Semi-Orbit**: `sin(time * 1.5) * 0.3` sway in opposite phases
- **Radial Burst**: `sin(time * 0.8) * 0.2` pulse toward/away from center
- **Circle Strafe**: 0.5 rad/sec rotation in opposite directions
- **Figure-8**: Lemniscate formula `x = cos(t) / (1 + sin²(t))`

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Movement restriction + `inBattleArena` flag

**Technical Achievements:**
- Separate movement restriction from camera controls (can look but not leave arena)
- Pattern-based animation system is easily extensible (add new patterns by extending BattlePattern)
- Raycaster targeting creates skill-based item usage
- Dodge/critical/fallback animations add visual depth and tactical feedback
- Arena walls provide clear visual boundaries without blocking camera view
- Fresh CanvasTexture creation for each pattern prevents memory leaks

**Visual Flow:**
1. Battle starts → Random pattern selected
2. Arena walls/floor spawn (8x8 glowing boundary)
3. Player can move within arena, camera rotates freely
4. Combatants follow selected pattern (circling/bursting/spiraling/etc.)
5. Attack triggers lunge → damage calculation → dodge/critical/fallback animations
6. Player aims at companion → uses potion → green flash + HP restored
7. Victory/defeat → Arena cleanup → Movement unrestricted

## 2025-10-09 - Tree Block Type Registry Fix (CRITICAL)

**Status: FIXED ✅**

### 🐛 Critical Bug: Trees Rendering as Stone Blocks

**Overview:**
Fixed a critical bug where all tree trunks and leaves were rendering/harvesting as stone blocks instead of wood. The issue existed since biome-specific trees were first added and was caused by missing block type definitions in the BlockTypes registry.

**The Problem:**
1. **Missing Block Types**: Tree generation code used block types like `'oak_wood-leaves'`, `'pine_wood-leaves'`, `'birch_wood-leaves'`, `'palm_wood-leaves'`, and `'dead_wood-leaves'`
2. **Registry Mismatch**: Only trunk types (`oak_wood`, `pine_wood`, `birch_wood`, `palm_wood`) were defined in `blockTypes` object - leaf types were missing
3. **Undefined Materials**: When `addBlock()` tried to access `this.materials['oak_wood-leaves']`, it returned `undefined`
4. **Fallback Rendering**: Trees rendered with broken/fallback materials, appearing as stone blocks
5. **Wrong Harvesting**: Harvesting tree trunks yielded stone/coal instead of wood

**The Fix:**

Added missing block type definitions in `src/VoxelWorld.js:6482-6496`:

```javascript
// NEW: Dead wood trunk type
dead_wood: { color: 0x3C3C3C, texture: 'dead_wood' },

// Tree-specific leaf types (matching tree generation function naming)
'oak_wood-leaves': { color: 0x228B22, texture: 'oak_wood-leaves' },   // Oak tree leaves
'pine_wood-leaves': { color: 0x006400, texture: 'pine_wood-leaves' }, // Pine needles
'palm_wood-leaves': { color: 0x9ACD32, texture: 'palm_wood-leaves' }, // Palm fronds
'birch_wood-leaves': { color: 0x90EE90, texture: 'birch_wood-leaves' }, // Birch leaves
'dead_wood-leaves': { color: 0x4A4A4A, texture: 'dead_wood-leaves' }, // Dead leaves (gray-brown)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Tree trunks now render as brown wood (oak, pine, palm, birch variants)
- ✅ Tree leaves render with proper green colors
- ✅ Dead trees render with gray trunks and leaves
- ✅ Harvesting trees yields wood blocks (with timber falling animation)
- ✅ No more stone/coal from tree trunks

**Root Cause Analysis:**
This bug existed since the introduction of biome-specific trees because the hyphenated leaf block types (`oak_wood-leaves`, etc.) were never added to the BlockTypes registry. The tree generation functions (lines 7606-7815) were using these types, but the materials system couldn't find them, causing a silent failure that defaulted to stone rendering.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/VoxelWorld.js:6482-6496` - Added 6 missing block type definitions

## 2025-10-09 - TreeWorker Performance & Memory Leak Fixes

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### 🌲 TreeWorker - Dedicated Worker for Tree Generation

**Overview:**
Moved tree generation off main thread to eliminate stuttering during chunk loading. Created TreeWorker to handle all tree placement logic in parallel with terrain generation, achieving smooth 60fps chunk streaming.

**Core Features:**
1. **TreeWorker Pipeline**: ChunkWorker → TreeWorker → Main Thread orchestration
2. **50% Tree Density Reduction**: Improved performance and gameplay balance (treeChance * 0.50)
3. **Ancient/Mega Tree Rarity**: 5% chunk-exclusive spawn (one special tree per chunk, no other trees)
   - 50/50 split: Regular ancient (3x3 trunk) vs Mega ancient (20-32 blocks tall)
   - Spawn at chunk center for landmark visibility
4. **LOD Tree System**: Simple colored blocks in distant chunks (brown trunk + green canopy)
5. **LOD Visual Distance**: Reduced from 3 → 2 chunks for fog compatibility and performance

**Implementation:**

- `src/workers/TreeWorker.js` (NEW - 376 lines)
  - Line 19-39: Message handling for INIT, GENERATE_TREES, GENERATE_LOD_TREES, CLEAR_CACHE
  - Line 56-176: `generateTreesForChunk()` with ancient chunk exclusivity (5% chance)
  - Line 62-96: Ancient chunk logic - single tree at chunk center
  - Line 98-162: Normal chunk logic - noise-based tree placement with spacing
  - Line 208-222: `shouldGenerateTree()` - 50% density reduction (0.50 multiplier)
  - Line 224-249: `hasNearbyTree()` - 3-block minimum spacing between trees
  - Line 291-375: `generateLODTreesForChunk()` - Simple colored blocks for LOD

- `src/worldgen/WorkerManager.js` - TreeWorker orchestration
  - Line 34-37: TreeWorker initialization and message handling
  - Line 98-129: `initializeTreeWorker()` - Create and configure TreeWorker
  - Line 193-232: `handleChunkReady()` - Forward heightMap/waterMap to TreeWorker
  - Line 234-264: `handleTreeWorkerMessage()` - Process TREES_READY responses
  - Line 266-291: `handleTreesReady()` - Merge trees data with chunk data for main thread

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Tree rendering integration
  - Line 7367-7399: `handleWorkerChunkData()` - Immediate tree rendering (no setTimeout delay)
  - Line 7370-7373: Auto-unload LOD chunk when full chunk loads (prevent double rendering)
  - Line 7377-7399: Process trees array from TreeWorker, render ancient/mega/regular trees

- `src/workers/ChunkWorker.js` - LOD tree generation
  - Line 296-357: `generateLODChunk()` with simple LOD trees (brown trunk + 3x3 green canopy)
  - Line 303-305: 50% tree density reduction matching TreeWorker

- `src/rendering/ChunkLODManager.js` - LOD system tuning
  - Line 28: `visualDistance = 2` (reduced from 3 for fog compatibility)
  - Reduces LOD chunks by 33%, better performance and less pop-in

**Performance Impact:**
- ✅ Eliminated main thread blocking during tree generation
- ✅ 50% fewer trees = 50% less geometry to render
- ✅ Ancient/mega trees now rare (5% of chunks) instead of 20% of all trees
- ✅ 33% fewer LOD chunks rendered (visualDistance 3 → 2)
- ✅ Memory usage stable at ~4.3GB (Code 1.9GB + Browser 1.8GB)
- ✅ Smooth 60fps chunk loading with no stuttering

**Known Visual Mismatch:**
⚠️ LOD trees in distant chunks do NOT match actual trees when full chunks load. This is expected behavior:
- LOD uses simplified noise for tree placement (ChunkWorker)
- Full chunks use TreeWorker with spacing logic and ancient chunk exclusivity
- Result: Trees "change position" when transitioning from LOD → full detail

### 🗑️ Memory Leak Fixes

**Billboard Disposal** (VoxelWorld.js):
- Line ~1186: `removeBlock()` now properly disposes billboard geometry, material, and textures
- Line ~1897: `refreshAllBillboards()` cleanup improved

**Falling Tree Block Disposal** (VoxelWorld.js):
- Line ~5014, 5125: `createFallingLeafBlock()` cleanup adds geometry/material disposal
- Line ~5214: `createFallingWoodBlock()` cleanup adds geometry/material disposal

**Result:** Memory usage dropped from 6.5GB → 4.3GB, system stable during extended gameplay

## 2025-10-08 - Critical Memory Leak Fix (Fog System)

**Status: FIXED**

### 🌫️ Fog Memory Leak & Optimization

**Overview:**
Fixed a critical memory leak in the fog system that was causing Gnome to crash and maxing out 8GB RAM. The fog system was creating new `THREE.Fog` objects every single frame (60+ times per second), leading to thousands of unreleased objects accumulating in memory.

**The Problem:**
1. **Duplicate Fog Creation**: Three separate locations were creating `new THREE.Fog()` objects:
   - `updateFog()` function (line 6902) - called every frame by day/night cycle
   - Day/night cycle update (lines 8471, 8476) - ran every frame
   - Render distance change handler (line 10547)
2. **Memory Leak**: Creating ~60 fog objects per second = 3,600 objects per minute
3. **No Garbage Collection**: THREE.Fog objects were never disposed, just orphaned
4. **Fog Not Visible**: `visualDist = 1` caused `fogStart = fogEnd = 16.0` (zero-width fog)

**The Fix:**
1. **Reuse One Fog Object** (VoxelWorld.js:6903-6911):
   - Create fog object ONCE on first call
   - Update properties (`color.setHex()`, `near`, `far`) instead of creating new objects
   - Prevents memory leak from object creation

2. **Consolidate to `updateFog()`** (VoxelWorld.js:8471-8474, 10538-10541):
   - Removed duplicate fog creation from day/night cycle
   - Removed duplicate fog creation from render distance handler
   - All fog updates now use centralized `updateFog()` method

3. **Fix Fog Visibility** (VoxelWorld.js:6896-6898):
   - Changed default `visualDist` from 1 to 3
   - Changed `fogStart` from `renderDistance + 1` to `renderDistance - 1`
   - Creates visible 32-block fog gradient instead of zero-width wall

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// BEFORE (Memory Leak):
this.scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(color, fogStart, fogEnd); // Creates new object every frame

// AFTER (Reuses Object):
if (!this.scene.fog) {
    this.scene.fog = new THREE.Fog(color, fogStart, fogEnd); // Create ONCE
} else {
    this.scene.fog.color.setHex(color);  // Update existing
    this.scene.fog.near = fogStart;
    this.scene.fog.far = fogEnd;
}
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No more fog-related memory leaks
- ✅ Fog visible with proper gradient (start: 0, end: 32 blocks)
- ✅ Day/night fog color changes work correctly
- ✅ Dramatically reduced memory usage

**Known Memory Issues Still To Investigate:**
1. **Aggressive Tree Scanning**: Chunk unloading scans y=1 to y=65 for every column (4,160 checks per chunk)
   - May be scanning too frequently or inefficiently
   - Tree cache system may need optimization
2. **LOD Visual Chunks**: Visual chunks beyond render distance may accumulate
   - Need to verify proper disposal when player moves
3. **Billboard Sprites**: Backpack, shrub, ghost sprites may not be cleaning up properly
4. **Chunk Mesh Pool**: Need to verify BlockResourcePool is recycling geometries

**Files Modified:**
- `src/VoxelWorld.js` (lines 6884-6914, 8471-8474, 10538-10541)

**Testing:**
- Console log should show: `🌫️ Fog updated: SOFT (start: 0.0, end: 32.0, renderDist: 1, chunkSize: 8, visualDist: 3)`
- Fog should be visible as gradual fade from clear to opaque
- Memory usage should stabilize instead of growing continuously

## 2025-10-07 - Grappling Hook & Animation System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### 🕸️ Grappling Hook with Trajectory Animation

**Overview:**
Implemented a fully functional grappling hook item that teleports the player with smooth bezier curve trajectory animation. This is the first feature in the new AnimationSystem.js, which will centralize all animations (explosions, particles, billboards, tree falling, etc.) to reduce VoxelWorld.js complexity.

**Core Features:**
1. **ToolBench Crafting**: Craft from 3 leaves + 1 feather, gives 10 charges
2. **Trajectory Animation**: Smooth bezier curve arc with apex calculation (like Spider-Man!)
3. **Visual Trajectory Line**: Light gray line shows flight path, fades out during animation
4. **Apex Calculation**: Arc height scales with distance (minimum 5 blocks, max distance * 0.3)
5. **Physics Integration**: Resets velocity during flight to prevent interference
6. **Icon System**: Enhanced graphics support with fuzzy matching for crafted items
7. **Non-Placeable**: Properly prevents grappling hook from being placed as block

**Implementation:**

- `src/AnimationSystem.js` (NEW - 177 lines) - Centralized animation management
  - `update()` - Frame-by-frame animation updates integrated with game loop
  - `animateGrapplingHook()` - Bezier curve trajectory with apex calculation
  - Quadratic Bezier formula: B(t) = (1-t)² * P0 + 2(1-t)t * P1 + t² * P2
  - Trajectory line with 30 segments, fades from opacity 0.8 → 0
  - Auto-cleanup: removes line from scene, disposes geometry/material
  - Placeholder methods for future: explosions, billboards, particles, tree falling

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Integration and fixes
  - Line 8-9: Import AnimationSystem
  - Line 172: Initialize `this.animationSystem = new AnimationSystem(this)`
  - Line 9008-9011: Update animation system in game loop
  - Line 9668-9719: Grappling hook with trajectory animation (instant teleport commented as backup)
  - Line 2129-2145: ToolBench tools check BEFORE crafted_ parsing to prevent Material Icons fallback
  - Line 9708-9710: Non-placeable items includes all grapple variants

- `src/ToolBenchSystem.js` - Charges system
  - Line 900: `createConsumable()` now gives `blueprint.charges` quantity (10 for grappling hook)
  - Line 549, 681: Pass context to `getItemIcon()` for proper enhanced graphics display

- `src/EnhancedGraphics.js` - Icon system improvements
  - Line 47-52: Texture aliases map grappling_hook/crafted_grappling_hook → grapple.png
  - Line 653-668: Fuzzy matching - if exact lookup fails, check if loaded tools contain lookup key

**Technical Details:**
- **Animation Duration**: 0.8 seconds (configurable)
- **Bezier Curve**: Quadratic (3 control points: start, apex, end)
- **Apex Formula**: `max(max(startY, endY) + 5, max(startY, endY) + distance * 0.3)`
- **Line Rendering**: THREE.Line with 30 BufferGeometry points
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal of geometry/material on animation complete

**Fixes Along the Way:**
- Fixed player.velocity NaN bug (was setting object instead of number)
- Fixed crafted items showing Material Icons instead of enhanced graphics
- Added Math.floor() to prevent float coordinate bugs
- Fixed duplicate `if` statement causing syntax error

**Next Steps (TODO):**
- Extract explosion animation → `animateExplosion()`
- Extract billboard floats → `animateBillboard()`
- Extract particle effects → `animateParticles()`
- Extract tree falling → `animateTreeFall()` (note: uses Cannon.js physics)
- Optional: Camera tilt based on trajectory velocity vector

## 2025-10-06 Late Night - 3D Arena Battle System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### ⚔️ Revolutionary 3D Combat System

**Overview:**
Replaced UI overlay battles with real-time 3D arena combat in the voxel world. Companions and enemies appear as 3D billboards sprites that circle each other, attack, and react to damage. This creates a unique hybrid of Minecraft's voxel world + Pokemon's creature battles + real-time 3D animations.

**Core Features:**
1. **3D Arena Combat**: Battles take place 4 blocks ahead of player in the voxel world
2. **Circling Animation**: Combatants orbit around arena center at 2-block radius
3. **Dynamic Sprite Poses**: Swap between `_ready_pose_enhanced.png` and `_attack_pose_enhanced.png`
4. **HP Bars**: Billboard sprites with color-coded health (green/yellow/red) above combatants
5. **Attack Animations**: Lunge forward, flash damage on hit, smooth lerp movement
6. **Context-Aware Victory Dialogue**: Companion comments based on remaining HP (95%+, 50%+, 25%+, <25%)
7. **Loot Integration**: Victory dialogue shows drops, adds to inventory on continue
8. **Free Camera**: Player can look around during combat but movement is disabled
9. **Turn-Based Logic**: Speed stat + d6 initiative, d20 + attack vs defense, d6 damage rolls

**Implementation:**

- `src/CombatantSprite.js` (NEW - 327 lines) - 3D sprite wrapper with HP bars, animations
  - `createSprite()` - 2-block tall sprites with ready pose

- `src/BattleSystem.js` - Redirect to BattleArena instead of UI overlay
  - Line 142-149: Call `voxelWorld.battleArena.startBattle()` instead of creating UI

- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Integration with main game loop
  - Line 13: Import BattleArena
  - Line 166: `this.battleArena = new BattleArena(this)`
  - Line 66: `this.movementEnabled = true` - Separate flag for movement vs camera
  - Line 9044-9046: Update battle arena in animation loop
  - Line 9063-9067: Skip movement but allow camera when `movementEnabled = false`
  - Line 11021-11051: `testCombat(enemyId)` debug method

- `src/App.js` - Expose debug command
  - Line 59-60: Global `window.testCombat()` function

- `src/AngryGhostSystem.js` - Direct PNG loading for angry ghosts
  - Line 61-89: Load `angry_ghost_ready_pose_enhanced.png` directly, no emoji fallback

- `src/EnhancedGraphics.js` - Support entities with only pose variants
  - `_loadEntityImages()` - Handle entities without base `.png` (only `_ready_pose_enhanced.png` and `_attack_pose_enhanced.png`)

**File Naming Convention:**
- `(enemyName)_ready_pose_enhanced.png` - Idle stance during combat
- `(enemyName)_attack_pose_enhanced.png` - Attack animation frame
- `(enemyName).jpeg` - Portrait for chat/UI only
- NO base `.png` files exist (e.g., no `angry_ghost.png`)

**Arena Positioning:**
- Arena spawns 4 blocks ahead in player's facing direction
- At player's Y level (feet position)
- 2-block radius orbit for combatants
- Combatants positioned at ground level (no elevation)
- HP bars float 1.5 blocks above sprite heads

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
testCombat()                // Spawn angry_ghost 4 blocks ahead
testCombat('angry_ghost')   // Same
testCombat('rat')           // Test with rat
testCombat('ghost')         // Test with ghost
```

**Technical Achievements:**
- Separate `movementEnabled` flag allows camera rotation during combat
- Clear input buffer prevents rushing forward after combat
- Texture swapping with proper disposal prevents memory leaks
- HP percentage-based dialogue adds personality
- Loot stored before sprite destruction prevents null references
- Billboard sprites always face camera for readability

**Visual Flow:**
1. Angry ghost triggers battle within 3-block range
2. Arena spawns 4 blocks ahead of player
3. Companion and enemy appear on opposite sides of circle
4. Combatants circle arena center while idle
5. Turn timer triggers attack (lunge forward, pose swap)
6. Damage flash, HP bar updates
7. Return to circling position
8. Repeat until knockout
9. Victory/defeat animations
10. Context-aware dialogue with loot info
11. Cleanup, restore controls

### 🖱️ Pointer Lock Management Overhaul

**Problem:** Pointer lock was re-engaging when modals/UI were still open, making buttons unclickable.

**Solutions:**

1. **Modal Switching** (CompanionCodex/WorldMap):
   - `hide(reEngagePointerLock = true)` - Optional parameter
   - Bookmark tab clicks: `hide(false)` - Don't re-engage
   - Close buttons/keys: `hide()` - Re-engages (default)

2. **Chat Smart Lock** (Chat.js:236-250):
   - Checks if workbench/toolbench is open before re-engaging
   - Releases lock on chat open, re-engages only if no modals active

3. **ESC Key Handling** (VoxelWorld.js:9369-9393):
   - ESC closes workbench → re-engages pointer lock
   - ESC closes toolbench → re-engages pointer lock
   - Handles before `controlsEnabled` check (always works)

**Result:** Seamless transitions between gameplay and UI, no stuck mouse states!

### 🎨 UI Naming Unification

## 2025-10-05 Evening - Halloween Ghost Billboards & Pumpkin System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### 🎃 Pumpkin Spawn System Fixes

**Bug Fixed:**
- **Noise Range Issue**: `multiOctaveNoise` returns `-1 to 1`, but pumpkin spawn check expected `0 to 1`
- **Old Rates**: 1.5% normal (actually 0.75%), 6% Halloween (actually 3%)
- **Fix**: Added noise normalization: `(pumpkinNoise + 1) / 2`
- **New Rates**: 3% normal, 15% on Halloween (Oct 31st)

**Code Location:**
- BiomeWorldGen.js:1256-1274 - Pumpkin spawn logic with fixed noise normalization

**Result:** Pumpkins are now **4x easier to find** (3% vs old buggy 0.75%)!

### 👻 Halloween Ghost Billboard System

**Features:**
1. **Oct 31st Only**: Ghost billboards only spawn on October 31st (or with debug mode)
2. **One Per Chunk**: First pumpkin in each chunk gets a floating ghost above it
3. **Floating Animation**: Ghosts bob up and down slowly (floatSpeed: 1.5, floatAmount: 0.2)
4. **Auto-Remove**: When ANY pumpkin in the chunk is harvested, the ghost disappears
5. **Transparent PNG Support**: Uses THREE.SpriteMaterial with proper alpha transparency

**Implementation:**
- VoxelWorld.js:68-69 - Ghost billboard tracking Map and debug flag
- VoxelWorld.js:276-302 - Auto-spawn ghost on first pumpkin per chunk
- VoxelWorld.js:741-787 - `createGhostBillboard()` function
- VoxelWorld.js:813-827 - Ghost animation in `animateBillboards()`
- VoxelWorld.js:1114-1133 - Remove ghost when pumpkin harvested
- App.js:47-51 - Expose `window['voxelApp']` for debugging

**Debug Command:**
```javascript
window.voxelApp.debugHalloween = true;
window.voxelApp.clearCaches();
```

## 2025-10-05 - Ancient Trees & Pillar Trees

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### 🌳 Ancient Tree System

**1. Regular Ancient Trees (15% spawn chance)**:
- **Thick 3x3 trunk** (9 blocks per layer vs normal 1x1)
- **Height**: 10-15 blocks tall (vs normal 5-8 blocks)
- **Large canopy**: 7x7 base for oak/birch/palm, conical radius-5 for pine
- **Biome-specific wood**: oak_wood, pine_wood, birch_wood, palm_wood
- **Massive loot**: ~117 wood blocks + 100+ leaf blocks when harvested
- **Code**: VoxelWorld.js:7609-7696

**2. Mega Ancient Trees (5% of ancient spawns = 1% overall)**:
- **Cone-shaped base**: 5x5 → 3x3 → 1x1 (8-13 blocks tall base)
- **Single trunk above**: 12-19 blocks tall
- **Total height**: 20-32 blocks (TWICE as tall as regular ancient!)
- **Massive canopy**: 11x11 base for oak/birch, radius-7 conical for pine
- **Visual landmark**: Visible from far away due to extreme height
- **Code**: VoxelWorld.js:7641-7676

**3. Spawn Logic** (VoxelWorld.js:7247-7254):
- 20% of all trees become ancient trees
- Top 25% of those (5% overall) become mega ancient
- Uses seeded noise for consistent placement
- Works with all biome tree types

### 🏛️ Pillar Trees (Quirky Bug Turned Feature)

**Origin Story:**
- Stone pillars were generated under trees to prevent floating appearance
- Created weird elevated trees on stone columns
- Bug was so aesthetically interesting we kept it as an intentional feature!

**Detection System** (VoxelWorld.js:7852-7879):
- Detects isolated stone/iron/sand columns (≤2 solid neighbors)
- Preserves stone pillar instead of converting to dirt
- Creates unique ancient ruins aesthetic

### 🏛️🌴 Mega Ancient Palm Trees (Another Happy Bug!)

**Origin Story:**
- Palm tree frond fix caused mega ancient palms to generate with inverted canopies
- Created bizarre alien monument structures in the desert
- Bug was so visually striking we kept it as an intentional feature!

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Massive 5x5 → 3x3 → 1x1 cone-shaped base
- 20-32 blocks tall
- Inverted tiered canopy (looks like alien architecture)
- Extremely rare (1% overall spawn rate)
- Desert biome landmarks

**Code Location:**
- VoxelWorld.js:7847-7890 - `generateMassiveCanopy()` creates the inverted effect
- **Intentionally NOT fixed** - unique aesthetic kept as feature

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**Inverted Palm Tree Bug** (VoxelWorld.js:7493):
- **Problem**: Extended fronds placed at `topY - 1` (hanging down into ground)
- **Fix**: Changed to `topY` for proper horizontal extension
- **Result**: Palm fronds now extend outward correctly

## 2025-10-05 - Tree Generation System Overhaul

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### 🐛 Six Critical Bugs Fixed

1. **Tree Density Multipliers Too Low** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1285-1295):
   - **Problem**: Multipliers were reduced from 2-12 down to 0.03-0.20, making trees virtually impossible to spawn
   - **Fix**: Doubled all multipliers back to proper values
     - Forest: 0.15 → 16 (100x increase!)
     - Plains: 0.08 → 20 (250x increase!)
     - Mountains: 0.12 → 20
     - Desert: 0.03 → 4
     - Tundra: 0.05 → 6

2. **Tree Placement Height Search Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7204):
   - **Problem**: Surface search only checked up to y=15, but mountains go to y=30 (mega mountains y=60!)
   - **Fix**: Extended search range from y=15 → y=64
   - Added check for 'air' blocks to properly detect surface

3. **Tree Save/Load Scan Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7718):
   - **Problem**: When unloading chunks, only scanned y=1-20 for tree trunks
   - **Fix**: Extended scan range from y=20 → y=65 for tree trunk detection

4. **Chunk Unload Cleanup Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7764):
   - **Problem**: Only removed blocks up to y=20 when unloading chunks
   - **Fix**: Extended cleanup range from y=20 → y=70 to remove ALL tree blocks

5. **Implemented Chunk-Based Tree Counter System** (BiomeWorldGen.js:33-41, 1023-1048, 1206-1248):
   - **Solution**: Added guaranteed minimum tree density system
   - **Guaranteed Tree Intervals**:
     - Forest: 1 tree per chunk (every chunk gets a tree!)
     - Plains: 1 tree per 3 chunks (~35 trees in 105-chunk walk)
     - Mountains: 1 tree per 2 chunks
     - Desert: 1 tree per 5 chunks (sparse)
     - Tundra: 1 tree per 4 chunks

6. **Fixed Variable Redeclaration Bug** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1299):
   - **Problem**: `centerX`, `centerZ`, `chunkBiome` declared twice in same scope
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration, reused variables from chunk counter logic

### 🌳 How the Dual Tree System Works

The new system uses TWO complementary methods:

1. **Noise-Based Trees** (Enhanced):
   - Random, natural placement using Perlin noise
   - 2x more likely to spawn than before
   - Creates organic, varied tree clusters
   - Respects biome-specific multipliers

2. **Guaranteed Trees** (New):
   - Forces 1 tree in chunk center every N chunks (based on biome)
   - Ensures minimum coverage even if noise check fails
   - Skips spacing restrictions to ensure placement
   - Tracks per-biome counters for proper distribution

### Gold Ore Implementation

- Added `gold` block type with texture support (`gold-sides.png`)
- Spawns every 13 blocks underground (rarer than iron's every 7 blocks)
- Base harvest time: 3500ms (harder than iron's 3000ms)
- Stone hammer efficiency: 0.6 (2100ms harvest time)
- 12% drop chance with stone hammer (vs iron's 15%)
- Requires stone_hammer or iron tool to harvest
- Gold ore has golden color (0xFFD700)
- Block type ID: 9

### Iron Ore Texture Support

- Added `iron-sides.png` texture support

- Iron ore now properly textured with multi-face block system

### Compass Recipe Overhaul

- Basic Compass: Changed from 3 iron + 1 stick → **3 gold + 1 stick**
- Makes compass more valuable and end-game worthy
- Gold is rarer resource, appropriate for navigation tool
- Crystal Compass upgrade still uses compass + 2 crystals

### Cache Management Utilities (VoxelWorld.js:5705-5859)

- **clearAllData()** - Original function (clears localStorage + IndexedDB)

## Earlier - Textured Crafted Objects with Subtle Color Tinting

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Successfully fixed textured crafted objects that were causing THREE.js r180 shader errors:

1. **Fixed Material Array Handling** (VoxelWorld.js:319-360):
   - Discovered `this.materials[material]` returns array of 6 materials (cube faces)
   - Extract first material with `Array.isArray()` check
   - Prevents JavaScript `.map` method confusion with THREE.js texture map

2. **Fresh Texture Creation**:
   - Create new `CanvasTexture` for each crafted object instead of reusing shared references
   - Proper texture configuration (NearestFilter, mipmaps, anisotropy)
   - Eliminates `uvundefined` shader errors caused by shared texture instances

3. **Subtle Color Tinting** (VoxelWorld.js:345-348):
   - Interpolate selected color 70% toward white (30% tint, 70% texture visibility)
   - Uses `tintColor.clone().lerp(white, 0.7)` for lighter tint
   - Textures now clearly visible with subtle color overlay
   - Adjustable tint strength for future ArtBench feature

4. **MeshBasicMaterial Usage**:
   - Switched from MeshLambertMaterial to MeshBasicMaterial for crafted objects
   - Simpler shader without lighting calculations
   - More stable with fresh texture instances

- Integrated with tree registry and harvesting system

### Specific Wood Types Throughout Codebase

- Replaced all legacy 'wood' references with specific types (oak_wood, pine_wood, birch_wood, palm_wood, dead_wood)
- Fixed backpack loot generation to give random wood type instead of generic 'wood'
- Updated workbench recipes to accept any wood type with flexible material matching

### Campfire Crafting System

- Recipe: 3x any wood type → campfire with glow effect
- Creates cylinder mesh with orange/red emissive material
- THREE.PointLight provides warm flickering glow (1.5 intensity, 10 unit range)
- **Fire particles disabled**: THREE.Points particle system caused shader errors in THREE.js r180
- Effect metadata stored in crafted items for future extensibility

---

## Earlier - Advanced Workbench System

### 3D Preview System

- `/src/worldgen/RegionNoiseCache.js` - Noise caching optimization
- Transferable objects for zero-copy data transfer
- Non-blocking chunk generation on worker thread

### Hybrid RAM + Disk Chunk Caching
- `/src/cache/ChunkCache.js` - LRU RAM cache (256 chunk limit)
- `/src/serialization/ChunkPersistence.js` - Disk/IndexedDB persistence
- `/src/serialization/ChunkSerializer.js` - Binary chunk format (Uint8Array)
- `/src/serialization/ModificationTracker.js` - Dirty chunk tracking
- Three-tier loading: RAM → Disk → Generate (worker)

**Result:** Smooth gameplay with render distance 3+, instant world loading from disk cache.

---

## Earlier - Workbench Crafting System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Craft Button & Material Consumption
- `WorkbenchSystem.js:1871` - `craftItem()` method

---

## Earlier - Climate-Based Biome Generation & Terrain Height System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Climate-Based Biome Generation (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 712-780)

- **Temperature Map**: North-south gradient (-1 cold to +1 hot) with noise variation
- **Moisture Map**: Perlin noise for wet/dry regions (-1 dry to +1 wet)
- **Biome Selection Grid**: Climate zones determine biome placement
  - Cold + Dry = Tundra
  - Cold + Wet = Forest
  - Hot + Dry = Desert
  - Temperate + Wet = Forest
  - Temperate + Moderate = Plains/Mountain
- **Result**: Geographic biome placement - no more snow next to deserts!

### Increased Terrain Heights (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 39-122)

- **Plains**: y=3-6 (gentle rolling hills)
- **Forest**: y=4-10 (forested hills)
- **Desert**: y=3-8 (sand dunes for mining)
- **Mountains**: y=15-30 (tall mountains, previously y=8-20)
- **Tundra**: y=4-10 (icy hills)
- **Mega Mountains**: y=40-60 (rare super mountains in mountain biomes only)

**Super Mountain System** (lines 783-808):
- Noise-based modifier creates rare mega mountains (>0.7 threshold)
- Only applies to mountain biomes
- Smooth height transition from normal (y=30) to mega (y=60)
- Intentionally hollow for future multi-layer dungeon integration

### Water System Improvements (ChunkWorker.js lines 140-150)

- **Water Level**: Lowered from y=4 to y=3 to reduce floating water blocks
- **Water Fill**: Fills empty space from terrain height to y=3
- **Biome Integration**: Water level stays below biome ground level

### Spawn Point Safety System (VoxelWorld.js lines 6266-6324)

- **Height Search**: Changed from y=15 to y=64 to detect tall mountains
- **Solid Ground Check**: Requires 3+ solid blocks below spawn point
- **Clear Space Above**: 6-block vertical clearance for player
- **Result**: No more spawning inside hollow mountains!

### Noise Parameter Tuning (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 170-175)

- **Problem**: "Borg cube" artifacts - perfect 8×8 cubes at chunk boundaries
- **Iteration 1**: scale: 0.012 (original) - TOO sharp, created vertical cliffs
- **Iteration 2**: scale: 0.003 - TOO smooth, created flat plateaus
- **Final Balance**: scale: 0.008, octaves: 5, persistence: 0.55
- **Result**: Natural slopes with some remaining artifacts (user accepted)

---

### Enhanced Biome Variants

- Multiple variants per biome (dense_forest, rocky_desert, oasis, etc.)
- Dynamic property modifications (tree density, shrub chance, surface blocks)
- Safe height range enforcement for all variants
- Biome-specific tree clustering and distribution

### Production-Ready Logging

- Debug mode flag (DEBUG_MODE = false for production)
- Statistical tracking without verbose logging
- Reduced log frequency (every 10th chunk, 128th block)
- Emergency alerts for critical issues only
- Performance monitoring with chunk generation stats

### Debug & Control Methods

- `enableDebugMode()` / `disableDebugMode()` for development
- `getStats()` for performance monitoring
- `resetStats()` for clean testing sessions
- Statistical summaries every 20 chunks

---

## Future Ideas & Requests

### 🌾 Farming & Agriculture System (Michelle's Request - Stardew Valley Inspired!)

**Prerequisites:** Fix pumpkin generation first!

**Basic Farming Mechanics:**
- **Tilled Soil**: Use tool to till grass/dirt into farmland
- **Seed Planting**: Plant pumpkin seeds, wheat, carrots, etc.
- **Growth Stages**: Visual progression from sprout → full grown
- **Watering System**: Water bucket or rain mechanics
- **Seasons**: Different crops for different times (if we add seasons)
- **Harvest**: Right-click fully grown crops to harvest

**Crop Ideas:**
- Pumpkins 🎃 (already have the block!)
- Wheat 🌾 (craft bread, feed animals)
- Carrots 🥕 (food, animal feed)
- Berries 🫐 (quick snack, crafting)
- Flowers 🌸 (decorative, bee farming?)

**Advanced Features:**
