## 2025-10-05 Evening - Halloween Ghost Billboards & Pumpkin System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üéÉ Pumpkin Spawn System Fixes

**Bug Fixed:**
- **Noise Range Issue**: `multiOctaveNoise` returns `-1 to 1`, but pumpkin spawn check expected `0 to 1`
- **Old Rates**: 1.5% normal (actually 0.75%), 6% Halloween (actually 3%)
- **Fix**: Added noise normalization: `(pumpkinNoise + 1) / 2`
- **New Rates**: 3% normal, 15% on Halloween (Oct 31st)

**Code Location:**
- BiomeWorldGen.js:1256-1274 - Pumpkin spawn logic with fixed noise normalization

**Result:** Pumpkins are now **4x easier to find** (3% vs old buggy 0.75%)!

### üëª Halloween Ghost Billboard System

**Features:**
1. **Oct 31st Only**: Ghost billboards only spawn on October 31st (or with debug mode)
2. **One Per Chunk**: First pumpkin in each chunk gets a floating ghost above it
3. **Floating Animation**: Ghosts bob up and down slowly (floatSpeed: 1.5, floatAmount: 0.2)
4. **Auto-Remove**: When ANY pumpkin in the chunk is harvested, the ghost disappears
5. **Transparent PNG Support**: Uses THREE.SpriteMaterial with proper alpha transparency

**Implementation:**
- VoxelWorld.js:68-69 - Ghost billboard tracking Map and debug flag
- VoxelWorld.js:276-302 - Auto-spawn ghost on first pumpkin per chunk
- VoxelWorld.js:741-787 - `createGhostBillboard()` function
- VoxelWorld.js:813-827 - Ghost animation in `animateBillboards()`
- VoxelWorld.js:1114-1133 - Remove ghost when pumpkin harvested
- App.js:47-51 - Expose `window['voxelApp']` for debugging

**Debug Command:**
```javascript
window.voxelApp.debugHalloween = true;
window.voxelApp.clearCaches();
```

## 2025-10-05 - Ancient Trees & Pillar Trees

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üå≥ Ancient Tree System

**1. Regular Ancient Trees (15% spawn chance)**:
- **Thick 3x3 trunk** (9 blocks per layer vs normal 1x1)
- **Height**: 10-15 blocks tall (vs normal 5-8 blocks)
- **Large canopy**: 7x7 base for oak/birch/palm, conical radius-5 for pine
- **Biome-specific wood**: oak_wood, pine_wood, birch_wood, palm_wood
- **Massive loot**: ~117 wood blocks + 100+ leaf blocks when harvested
- **Code**: VoxelWorld.js:7609-7696

**2. Mega Ancient Trees (5% of ancient spawns = 1% overall)**:
- **Cone-shaped base**: 5x5 ‚Üí 3x3 ‚Üí 1x1 (8-13 blocks tall base)
- **Single trunk above**: 12-19 blocks tall
- **Total height**: 20-32 blocks (TWICE as tall as regular ancient!)
- **Massive canopy**: 11x11 base for oak/birch, radius-7 conical for pine
- **Visual landmark**: Visible from far away due to extreme height
- **Code**: VoxelWorld.js:7641-7676

**3. Spawn Logic** (VoxelWorld.js:7247-7254):
- 20% of all trees become ancient trees
- Top 25% of those (5% overall) become mega ancient
- Uses seeded noise for consistent placement
- Works with all biome tree types

### üèõÔ∏è Pillar Trees (Quirky Bug Turned Feature)

**Origin Story:**
- Stone pillars were generated under trees to prevent floating appearance
- Created weird elevated trees on stone columns
- Bug was so aesthetically interesting we kept it as an intentional feature!

**Detection System** (VoxelWorld.js:7852-7879):
- Detects isolated stone/iron/sand columns (‚â§2 solid neighbors)
- Preserves stone pillar instead of converting to dirt
- Creates unique ancient ruins aesthetic

### üèõÔ∏èüå¥ Mega Ancient Palm Trees (Another Happy Bug!)

**Origin Story:**
- Palm tree frond fix caused mega ancient palms to generate with inverted canopies
- Created bizarre alien monument structures in the desert
- Bug was so visually striking we kept it as an intentional feature!

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Massive 5x5 ‚Üí 3x3 ‚Üí 1x1 cone-shaped base
- 20-32 blocks tall
- Inverted tiered canopy (looks like alien architecture)
- Extremely rare (1% overall spawn rate)
- Desert biome landmarks

**Code Location:**
- VoxelWorld.js:7847-7890 - `generateMassiveCanopy()` creates the inverted effect
- **Intentionally NOT fixed** - unique aesthetic kept as feature

### üêõ Bug Fixes

**Inverted Palm Tree Bug** (VoxelWorld.js:7493):
- **Problem**: Extended fronds placed at `topY - 1` (hanging down into ground)
- **Fix**: Changed to `topY` for proper horizontal extension
- **Result**: Palm fronds now extend outward correctly

## 2025-10-05 - Tree Generation System Overhaul

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### üêõ Six Critical Bugs Fixed

1. **Tree Density Multipliers Too Low** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1285-1295):
   - **Problem**: Multipliers were reduced from 2-12 down to 0.03-0.20, making trees virtually impossible to spawn
   - **Fix**: Doubled all multipliers back to proper values
     - Forest: 0.15 ‚Üí 16 (100x increase!)
     - Plains: 0.08 ‚Üí 20 (250x increase!)
     - Mountains: 0.12 ‚Üí 20
     - Desert: 0.03 ‚Üí 4
     - Tundra: 0.05 ‚Üí 6

2. **Tree Placement Height Search Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7204):
   - **Problem**: Surface search only checked up to y=15, but mountains go to y=30 (mega mountains y=60!)
   - **Fix**: Extended search range from y=15 ‚Üí y=64
   - Added check for 'air' blocks to properly detect surface

3. **Tree Save/Load Scan Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7718):
   - **Problem**: When unloading chunks, only scanned y=1-20 for tree trunks
   - **Fix**: Extended scan range from y=20 ‚Üí y=65 for tree trunk detection

4. **Chunk Unload Cleanup Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7764):
   - **Problem**: Only removed blocks up to y=20 when unloading chunks
   - **Fix**: Extended cleanup range from y=20 ‚Üí y=70 to remove ALL tree blocks

5. **Implemented Chunk-Based Tree Counter System** (BiomeWorldGen.js:33-41, 1023-1048, 1206-1248):
   - **Solution**: Added guaranteed minimum tree density system
   - **Guaranteed Tree Intervals**:
     - Forest: 1 tree per chunk (every chunk gets a tree!)
     - Plains: 1 tree per 3 chunks (~35 trees in 105-chunk walk)
     - Mountains: 1 tree per 2 chunks
     - Desert: 1 tree per 5 chunks (sparse)
     - Tundra: 1 tree per 4 chunks

6. **Fixed Variable Redeclaration Bug** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1299):
   - **Problem**: `centerX`, `centerZ`, `chunkBiome` declared twice in same scope
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration, reused variables from chunk counter logic

### üå≥ How the Dual Tree System Works

The new system uses TWO complementary methods:

1. **Noise-Based Trees** (Enhanced):
   - Random, natural placement using Perlin noise
   - 2x more likely to spawn than before
   - Creates organic, varied tree clusters
   - Respects biome-specific multipliers

2. **Guaranteed Trees** (New):
   - Forces 1 tree in chunk center every N chunks (based on biome)
   - Ensures minimum coverage even if noise check fails
   - Skips spacing restrictions to ensure placement
   - Tracks per-biome counters for proper distribution

## Earlier - Textured Crafted Objects with Subtle Color Tinting

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Successfully fixed textured crafted objects that were causing THREE.js r180 shader errors:

1. **Fixed Material Array Handling** (VoxelWorld.js:319-360):
   - Discovered `this.materials[material]` returns array of 6 materials (cube faces)
   - Extract first material with `Array.isArray()` check
   - Prevents JavaScript `.map` method confusion with THREE.js texture map

2. **Fresh Texture Creation**:
   - Create new `CanvasTexture` for each crafted object instead of reusing shared references
   - Proper texture configuration (NearestFilter, mipmaps, anisotropy)
   - Eliminates `uvundefined` shader errors caused by shared texture instances

3. **Subtle Color Tinting** (VoxelWorld.js:345-348):
   - Interpolate selected color 70% toward white (30% tint, 70% texture visibility)
   - Uses `tintColor.clone().lerp(white, 0.7)` for lighter tint
   - Textures now clearly visible with subtle color overlay
   - Adjustable tint strength for future ArtBench feature

4. **MeshBasicMaterial Usage**:
   - Switched from MeshLambertMaterial to MeshBasicMaterial for crafted objects

## Earlier - Climate-Based Biome Generation & Terrain Height System

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### Climate-Based Biome Generation (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 712-780)

- **Temperature Map**: North-south gradient (-1 cold to +1 hot) with noise variation
- **Moisture Map**: Perlin noise for wet/dry regions (-1 dry to +1 wet)
- **Biome Selection Grid**: Climate zones determine biome placement
  - Cold + Dry = Tundra
  - Cold + Wet = Forest
  - Hot + Dry = Desert
  - Temperate + Wet = Forest
  - Temperate + Moderate = Plains/Mountain
- **Result**: Geographic biome placement - no more snow next to deserts!

### Increased Terrain Heights (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 39-122)

- **Plains**: y=3-6 (gentle rolling hills)
- **Forest**: y=4-10 (forested hills)
- **Desert**: y=3-8 (sand dunes for mining)
- **Mountains**: y=15-30 (tall mountains, previously y=8-20)
- **Tundra**: y=4-10 (icy hills)
- **Mega Mountains**: y=40-60 (rare super mountains in mountain biomes only)

**Super Mountain System** (lines 783-808):
- Noise-based modifier creates rare mega mountains (>0.7 threshold)
- Only applies to mountain biomes
- Smooth height transition from normal (y=30) to mega (y=60)
- Intentionally hollow for future multi-layer dungeon integration

### Water System Improvements (ChunkWorker.js lines 140-150)

- **Water Level**: Lowered from y=4 to y=3 to reduce floating water blocks
- **Water Fill**: Fills empty space from terrain height to y=3
- **Biome Integration**: Water level stays below biome ground level

### Spawn Point Safety System (VoxelWorld.js lines 6266-6324)

- **Height Search**: Changed from y=15 to y=64 to detect tall mountains
- **Solid Ground Check**: Requires 3+ solid blocks below spawn point
- **Clear Space Above**: 6-block vertical clearance for player
- **Result**: No more spawning inside hollow mountains!

### Noise Parameter Tuning (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 170-175)

- **Problem**: "Borg cube" artifacts - perfect 8√ó8 cubes at chunk boundaries
- **Iteration 1**: scale: 0.012 (original) - TOO sharp, created vertical cliffs
- **Iteration 2**: scale: 0.003 - TOO smooth, created flat plateaus
- **Final Balance**: scale: 0.008, octaves: 5, persistence: 0.55
- **Result**: Natural slopes with some remaining artifacts (user accepted)
