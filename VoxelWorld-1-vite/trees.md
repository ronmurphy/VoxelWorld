ok,  so, the leaves are not despawning when the trunk is removed.  we need to play the 
animation when any part of the trunk is removed, with or without the machete.  the machete 
only makes the harvesting timer shorter, and if it machete is used, it collects the leaves 
on the tree, weither the tree trunk is harvsted or not (so if it i usedon the trunk or on 
the leaves themselves)   when the player moves out of the chunk, the leaves are still seen,
 even when the chunk isnt there any more.  please scan the last git push's diff, it had the
 animation right, but youknow, lets keep if any trunk in the tree is chopped, with or 
without the machete.  also, the trees are still sittting on shrubs... the shrub DOES give 
wood in the inventory, so that may be why the system thinks it's a tree base, idk.

‚óè You're right, there are several issues with my implementation. Let me check the git diff
  to see what the working animation looked like before, and then fix these problems:

‚óè Perfect! I can see the working version. The key differences are:
  1. It used this.scanTreeStructure(harvestedX, harvestedY + 1, harvestedZ) (looking above
  the harvested block)
  2. It always played the animation for any wood block
  3. The cascadeDisconnectedLeaves was called properly

  Let me also check the shrub issue and create a todo list:

‚óè Now let me revert the checkTreeFalling method to work like the original version but keep
  the "any trunk block" behavior:

‚óè Good! Now let me fix the shrub issue. The problem might be that shrubs give wood when
  harvested, so the system might be confused. Let me check how shrubs are detected vs wood
  blocks:

‚óè Search(pattern: "userData.*type.*shrub|isWoodBlock.*shrub"", path: "src/VoxelWorld.js",
        output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 0 lines 
  ‚éø  Found 11 new diagnostic issues in 1 file (ctrl-o to expand)

‚óè Let me check the isWoodBlock method to make sure it doesn't include shrubs:

‚óè Search(pattern: "isWoodBlock.*=", path: "src/VoxelWorld.js", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 20 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè Good, the isWoodBlock method doesn't include 'shrub', so that's not the issue. The
  problem might be that my tree spawning check is not working correctly. Let me fix the
  tree spawning logic to be more robust:

‚óè Update(src/VoxelWorld.js)
  ‚éø  Updated src/VoxelWorld.js with 12 additions and 6 removals

       4329                        const checkBlock = this.getBlock(worldX + dx, 
              treeHeight, worldZ + dz);
       4330 -                      if (checkBlock && (checkBlock.type === 'shrub' || 
            - this.isWoodBlock(checkBlock.type))) {
       4331 -                          console.log(`üö´ Tree blocked at 
            - (${worldX},${treeHeight},${worldZ}) by nearby ${checkBlock.type} at

       4332 -                          return; // Don't generate if nearby vegetation 
            - exists
       4330 +                      if (checkBlock) {
       4331 +                          if (checkBlock.type === 'shrub') {
       4332 +                              console.log(`üö´ Tree blocked at

       4333 +                              return; // Don't generate if shrub nearby
       4334 +                          }
       4335 +                          if (this.isWoodBlock(checkBlock.type)) {
       4336 +                              console.log(`üö´ Tree blocked at 
            + (${worldX},${treeHeight},${worldZ}) by ${checkBlock.type} at (${worldX +

       4337 +                              return; // Don't generate if another tree

       4338 +                          }
       4339                        }
       4340                    }
       4341                }

‚óè Now let me also fix the machete behavior. The machete should only affect harvest speed
  and leaf collection, not the tree falling animation. Let me check how the machete is
  currently being used in the tree system:

‚óè Search(pattern: "machete.*tree|tree.*machete|machete.*leaf|leaf.*machete"", path:

  ‚éø  Found 43 lines (ctrl+o to expand)
  ‚éø  Found 9 new diagnostic issues in 1 file (ctrl-o to expand)

‚óè I can see the machete is properly implemented for leaf collection. Now I need to also
  implement machete harvesting for tree trunks themselves and direct leaf harvesting. But
  first, let me check if the harvest speed logic includes machete:

‚óè Search(pattern: "getBaseHarvestTime|machete.*speed|speed.*machete"", path:
        "src/VoxelWorld.js", output_mode: "content")
  ‚éø  Found 0 lines 

‚óè Let me search for the harvest time calculation:

        "content")
  ‚éø  Found 31 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

‚óè I need to add machete to the tool efficiency. Let me also fix the machete to work on both
   wood blocks and leaf blocks:

       3325                };
       3326    

‚óè Great! Now I need to also implement direct leaf harvesting with the machete. Let me also
  add support for leaf harvesting that gives leaves to inventory:
