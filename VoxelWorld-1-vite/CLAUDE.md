### Technologies

- **Three.js r180** - 3D rendering engine
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Electron** - Desktop application wrapper
- **Capacitor** - Mobile app framework (configured but not actively used)

## Game Controls

### Keyboard Controls
- **WASD** - Movement
- **Space** - Jump
- **Mouse** - Look around (requires pointer lock)
- **Left Click** - Hold to harvest blocks (tool-based efficiency)
- **Right Click** - Place blocks from inventory
- **Keys 1-4** - Select hotbar slots
- **Key 5** - Toggle backpack inventory
- **Q/E** - Navigate hotbar slots
- **E** - Interact (workbench, toolbench)
- **M** - Toggle World Map (Explorer's Journal)
- **C** - Toggle Companion Codex
- **ESC** - Close modals (workbench, toolbench, backpack)

### Mobile Controls
- **Left Joystick** - Movement
- **Right Joystick** - Look around
- **Touch Hotbar** - Select items

## Current Architecture Issues

### VoxelWorld.js (10,900+ lines - TOO LARGE)

**Still needs extraction:**
- Physics system (collision, movement, gravity)
- BlockTypes definitions and materials
- Player controller (input, camera)
- UI systems (notifications, minimap, mobile joysticks)
- Save/load system
- Main game loop and orchestration
- Combat system (pending - will be extracted to BattleSystem.js)

**Goal:** Reduce to <2000 lines (orchestrator only)

## Important Technical Notes

### Block Type Synchronization
Block type IDs must stay synchronized across:
- `VoxelWorld.js` - BlockTypes definition
- `ChunkWorker.js` - Worker generation
- `ChunkSerializer.js` - Serialization
- `WorkerManager.js` - Deserialization

### THREE.js r180 Compatibility
- THREE.Points particles cause shader errors - avoid using
- Use Billboard sprites (SpriteMaterial) instead for floating elements
- Fresh CanvasTexture instances required for crafted objects (no shared references)

### Pointer Lock Management
- Pointer lock must be released when opening ANY modal (Map, Codex, Chat, Workbench, ToolBench)
- Only re-engage pointer lock when CLOSING modals completely (Close button, ESC key, toggle key)
- DO NOT re-engage when switching between related modals (bookmark tab navigation)
- Chat.js checks for open workbench/toolbench before re-engaging
- Bookmark clicks pass `reEngagePointerLock: false` to `hide()` methods

### Cache Management
Console utilities (exposed via `window.voxelApp`):
- `clearCaches()` - Clear caches but preserve saved games
- `clearAllData()` - Clear localStorage + IndexedDB
- `nuclearClear()` - Nuclear option (wipe everything + hard reload)

### Intentional "Bugs" (Features)
- **Hollow Mountains**: For future dungeon integration
- **Floating Islands**: Rare occurrence, kept as special exploration feature
- **Pillar Trees**: Trees on stone columns - quirky aesthetic kept intentionally
- **Mega Ancient Palm Trees**: Inverted canopy effect in desert - alien monument aesthetic

## Current Priorities (2025-10-06)

### Critical Features
1. **Auto-Battler Combat System**: Pokemon-style companion battles (NEXT PRIORITY)
   - Battle UI overlay when encountering enemies
   - Turn-based combat with companion stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
   - Player commands (Fight, Items, Switch, Run)
   - Victory/defeat outcomes with rewards/consequences

### High Priority Features
1. **Greedy Meshing**: Required for ocean biome (10,000 water blocks = 10,000 draw calls currently)
2. **3D Cave Systems**: Perlin worms to carve natural caves in hollow mountains
3. **Ruins Generation**: Not spawning consistently (check BiomeWorldGen spawn rates)

### Medium Priority Bugs
1. **Player Hitbox Too Wide**: Needs 2-block gap instead of 1, can walk into blocks
2. **Biome Labeling Bug**: Shows "Plains" when on mountains (height-based detection issue)
3. **Terrain Smoothing**: Reduce "Borg cube" artifacts at chunk boundaries
4. **Drag & Drop Inventory**: Currently only right-click transfer works

### Long-Term Refactoring
1. **Continue VoxelWorld.js Refactoring**: Extract Physics, PlayerController, UI, SaveLoad (reduce from 10,900+ lines to <2000)

### Optional Enhancements
1. **Companion Portrait UI**: Clickable companion portrait near hotbar
   - Click to open chat with active companion
   - Re-read tutorials, get hints, friendly interactions
   - Show HP/status during battles
2. **Halloween Ghost Following**: Ruin ghosts and night forest ghosts with cumulative spawn chance
3. **Floating Islands**: Add special loot, quest markers, visual effects
4. **Farming System**: Stardew Valley-inspired agriculture (see CHANGELOG.md)

## Debug Commands

```javascript
// Enable Halloween mode year-round
window.voxelApp.debugHalloween = true;

// Clear caches (preserves saves)
window.voxelApp.clearCaches();

// Nuclear clear (wipe everything)
window.voxelApp.nuclearClear();

// BiomeWorldGen debug mode
window.voxelApp.worldGen.enableDebugMode();
window.voxelApp.worldGen.getStats();
```

## Development Notes

- Project uses ES modules throughout
- VoxelWorld initializes in fullscreen mode by default
- Performance auto-optimized through chunk culling and device-specific settings
- See CHANGELOG.md for detailed feature implementation history
