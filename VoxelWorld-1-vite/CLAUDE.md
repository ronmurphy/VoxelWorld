- **Capacitor** - Mobile app framework (configured but not actively used)

## Game Controls

### Keyboard Controls
- **WASD** - Movement
- **Space** - Jump
- **Mouse** - Look around (requires pointer lock)
- **Left Click** - Hold to harvest blocks (tool-based efficiency)
- **Right Click** - Place blocks from inventory
- **Keys 1-4** - Select hotbar slots
- **Key 5** - Toggle backpack inventory (releases/captures mouse pointer)
- **Q/E** - Navigate hotbar slots

### Mobile Controls
- **Left Joystick** - Movement
- **Right Joystick** - Look around
- **Touch Hotbar** - Select items

### Game Progression
1. **Find the Backpack** - Red dot on minimap shows location
2. **Harvest Resources** - Different tools have different efficiency
3. **Manage Inventory** - 4-slot hotbar + 25-slot backpack storage
4. **Tool Requirements** - Some blocks require specific tools (iron needs iron/stone tools)

## Development Notes

The project uses ES modules throughout. The main application initializes VoxelWorld in fullscreen mode by default. A workbench mode is planned but not yet implemented (ShapeForgeWorkbench.js).

The VoxelWorld class is fully self-contained with its own event handlers, save system, and UI elements. Performance is automatically optimized through chunk culling and device-specific render distance settings.

### Recent Updates
- Billboard system for collectibles with floating animations
- Tool-based harvesting with efficiency calculations
- Backpack discovery system with random loot generation
- Keyboard hotbar selection with visual feedback
- Pointer lock management for inventory interaction
- **Workbench System**: Interactive workbench modal with material selection, shape builder, and 3D preview area
- **Full Inventory Management**: Right-click transfers between hotbar and backpack storage
- **Item Placement/Harvesting**: Items properly removed from inventory when placed, harvestable back
- **Smart Notifications**: Enhanced notification system with icons and auto-dismiss
- **Proximity Interaction**: Press E near workbench to open crafting interface

### Latest Session - Collision System Overhaul
- **Removed Auto-Jump System**: Eliminated problematic auto-jump that caused continuous jumping bugs
- **Implemented Hitbox Collision**: Replaced point-based collision with industry-standard AABB hitbox system
- **Player Hitbox**: 0.6w × 1.8h × 0.6d units with full volume coverage
- **Block Hitboxes**: Perfect 1×1×1 cube collision detection
- **Wall Sliding Preserved**: Maintains smooth movement along obstacles
- **Issues Remaining**: Still has collision bypasses with multi-block structures (2+ stacked blocks)

### ✅ COMPLETED: Advanced Workbench System (Latest Session)
1. **3D Preview System**: Fully functional 3D shape preview with orbit controls
   - Fixed recipe shape extraction from `recipe.shapes[0].type`
   - Fixed renderer sizing issues (0x0 → proper container dimensions)
   - Fixed JavaScript crashes in THREE.js getSize() calls
   - Interactive 3D preview with mouse drag/zoom/pan controls

2. **Smart Material Filtering**: Dynamic recipe filtering based on material selection
   - Visual selection indicators (golden borders) for selected materials
   - Recipe book filters to show only craftable items with selected materials
   - Reset button to clear selections and show all recipes
   - Multi-material selection support with Set-based state management

3. **Complete Recipe System**: Full recipe book with basic shapes and complex structures
   - Basic shapes: Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Pyramid, Stairs, Wall, Hollow Cube
   - Complex structures: Castle Wall, Tower Turret, Simple House
   - Material requirements system with inventory integration
   - Shape size scaling based on available material quantities

### Next Session TODO

1. **Complete Workbench Crafting System** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - **Craft Button**: Add "Craft" button to workbench that consumes materials and creates the crafted object
   - **Inventory Integration**: Place crafted items into player inventory (hotbar or backpack)
   - **Material Consumption**: Subtract required materials from inventory when crafting
   - **Error Handling**: Check if player has enough materials before allowing craft
   - **Crafted Item Types**: Create new item types for crafted objects (e.g., "wooden_cube", "stone_tower")

2. **Enhanced Inventory Management** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - **Drag & Drop**: Implement drag-and-drop between backpack and hotbar slots
   - **Right-Click Transfer**: Already exists but needs refinement for crafted items
   - **Item Stacking**: Allow multiple of same item type in single slot (show count)
   - **Hotbar Integration**: Ensure crafted items can be selected and placed in world
   - **Visual Updates**: Real-time inventory UI updates when items are moved/consumed

3. **3D Object Placement System** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - **Crafted Item Placement**: Allow placing crafted 3D objects in the voxel world
   - **Object Collision**: Crafted objects should have proper collision detection
   - **Object Harvesting**: Allow breaking placed crafted objects to get materials back
   - **Object Storage**: Save/load placed 3D objects with world data
   - **Object Interaction**: Different interaction methods for complex objects vs simple blocks

### Implementation Plan for Crafting:

```javascript
// Workbench crafting flow:
1. Player selects material (wood) → Visual feedback
2. Player selects recipe (cube) → 3D preview shows
3. Player clicks "Craft" button → Check materials
4. If sufficient materials → Consume materials, create item
5. Add "wooden_cube" to inventory → Update hotbar/backpack UI
6. Player can select crafted item from hotbar
7. Player can place "wooden_cube" in world as 3D object
```

### Technical Approach:

**Crafted Item System:**
- Extend inventory to support crafted object types
- Add item metadata (material, shape, size) to track crafted properties
- Create placement system that handles both blocks and 3D objects
- Implement object-specific collision volumes and interaction

**Inventory Enhancements:**
- Add item categories (blocks, tools, crafted_objects)
- Implement item transferring with proper validation
- Add visual indicators for different item types
- Support item metadata display in tooltips

4. **Code Architecture Refactoring** (CRITICAL PRIORITY):
   **VoxelWorld.js has grown too large and needs logical separation into modular files**

   Current issues:
   - Single file approaching 4000+ lines
   - Multiple responsibilities mixed together
   - Difficult to maintain and debug
   - Poor separation of concerns

   **Refactoring Plan:**
   - **Physics.js**: Extract collision system, movement, gravity, and physics utilities
   - **BlockTypes.js**: Extract block definitions, properties, material systems
   - **WorldGeneration.js**: Extract chunk system, biome generation, terrain generation
   - **PlayerController.js**: Extract player movement, input handling, camera controls
   - **InventorySystem.js**: Extract backpack, hotbar, item management
   - **SaveLoadSystem.js**: Extract save/load with LocalStorage → IndexedDB migration for large worlds
   - **UI.js**: Extract notifications, minimap, status bar, mobile joysticks
   - **Workbench.js**: Extract workbench modal and crafting system
   - Keep VoxelWorld.js as main orchestrator class

   **Implementation Strategy:**
   1. **Create modular ES6 classes** with clear interfaces
   2. **Use dependency injection** - pass VoxelWorld instance to modules that need it
   3. **Maintain existing API** - no breaking changes to external interfaces
   4. **Extract incrementally** - one module at a time to avoid breaking everything
   5. **Add proper imports/exports** for clean module boundaries

   **Example Structure:**
   ```javascript
   // Physics.js
   export class PhysicsEngine {
     constructor(voxelWorld) { this.world = voxelWorld; }
     checkCollision(position, hitbox) { /* ... */ }
     updateMovement(player, deltaTime) { /* ... */ }
   }

   // VoxelWorld.js (orchestrator)
   import { PhysicsEngine } from './Physics.js';
   import { WorldGenerator } from './WorldGeneration.js';

   class VoxelWorld {
     constructor(container) {
       this.physics = new PhysicsEngine(this);
       this.worldGen = new WorldGenerator(this);
       // ...
     }
   }
   ```

   **Benefits:**
   - **Maintainable**: Each file has single responsibility
   - **Testable**: Modules can be tested independently
   - **Debuggable**: Easier to locate and fix issues
   - **Scalable**: New features can be added as separate modules
   - **Reusable**: Modules can be reused in other projects

3. **Collision System Refinement** (OPTIONAL):
   - Current hitbox system still allows clipping through multi-block structures
   - Consider swept AABB or continuous collision detection for better accuracy
   - May need to implement collision response with proper separation resolution

4. **UI Updates for Item Transfers**:
   - Emoji icons don't update when items move between hotbar/backpack
   - Need real-time visual feedback for inventory changes
   - Ensure correct items are displayed after transfers

-- was working on before i hit the 5 hour limit, to help claude pick back up on he work plan, here was the last messages in the terminal.

 Current Architecture Issues:

  1. Dual Systems: Legacy this.inventory vs New this.hotbarSlots/backpackSlots
  2. Inconsistent Usage: Some functions use legacy, others use new system
  3. Broken Sync: Backpack generation doesn't sync to slots
  4. Display Confusion: UI tries to display from both systems

  This is exactly what the user predicted - having two systems always leads to issues.

  Let me present the plan for a clean solution.

● Perfect analysis! You're absolutely right - dual systems are a nightmare. Here's what I found:

  🔍 Current Architecture Problems

  The Issue Flow:
  1. Backpack found → generateBackpackLoot() runs
  2. Legacy system populated: this.inventory.wood = 8, this.inventory.stone = 4, etc.
  3. New system stays empty: this.hotbarSlots = [{ itemType: 'grass', quantity: 0 }]
  4. Block placement checks new system: Finds quantity: 0, fails
  5. Display shows 0 quantities even though items exist in legacy inventory

  Architecture Conflict:
  - Legacy System: this.inventory = { grass: 4, stone: 8, wood: 14 }
  - New System: this.hotbarSlots = [{ itemType: 'grass', quantity: 0 }]
  - Sync functions exist but aren't called consistently

  📋 Proposed Solution: Go Full Slot System

  Why Eliminate Legacy System:
  - ✅ Single source of truth
  - ✅ Natural stacking support (8-item limit per slot)
  - ✅ Better for future features (upgradeable backpack slots)
  - ✅ Cleaner architecture
  - ✅ No sync complexity
                                                                                                               
●User approved Claude's plan:
  ⎿  🎯 Plan: Eliminate Dual Inventory Systems

     Goal: Convert to single slot-based inventory system, removing the legacy this.inventory object entirely.

     Phase 1: Core Inventory Conversion

     - Convert generateBackpackLoot() to populate hotbarSlots and backpackSlots directly using addToInventory()
     - Convert harvesting functions to use addToInventory() instead of this.inventory[item]++
     - Convert crafting material consumption to use slot system
     - Remove all syncInventoryToSlots() calls

     Phase 2: Display & Interaction Fixes

     - Fix hotbar display to show proper item quantities from slots
     - Fix "BAG" display for slot 5 (backpack button)
     - Ensure item counts display correctly on hotbar icons
     - Test block placement works with populated slots

     Phase 3: Complete Legacy Removal

     - Remove this.inventory object initialization entirely
     - Remove all sync functions (syncInventoryToSlots, syncSlotsToInventory)
     - Update any remaining functions that reference legacy inventory
     - Clean up console logging to use slot data

     Phase 4: Testing & Validation

     - Test backpack finding populates slots correctly
     - Test block placement works from populated hotbar
     - Test item stacking respects 8-item limit
     - Test workbench placement specifically
     - Verify no [object Object] displays

     Result: Single, clean inventory system using slots with proper stacking and no synchronization complexity.

✻ Thinking…

  Great! The user approved the plan. Now I need to execute the plan to eliminate the dual inventory systems and go with a pure 
  slot-based approach.

  Let me start by updating the todo list to track the phases, then begin with Phase 1.

  The key tasks are:
  1. Convert generateBackpackLoot() to use addToInventory()
  2. Convert harvesting to use addToInventory() 
  3. Convert crafting to use slot system
  4. Remove sync calls
  5. Fix display issues
  6. Remove legacy inventory entirely

  Let me start with Phase 1.

● Perfect! Let's execute the plan to eliminate the dual inventory system mess.

✻ Thinking…

  Great! Now let me start with Phase 1 - converting the generateBackpackLoot() function to use the slot system instead of the legacy 
  inventory.

  I need to:
  1. Replace all the this.inventory.item = value with calls to this.addToInventory(item, value)
  2. Remove the legacy inventory iteration and console logging
  3. Make sure it properly populates the slots

  Let me find and update the generateBackpackLoot function first.

● Phase 1: Core Inventory Conversion

  Let me start by converting the generateBackpackLoot() function to use the new slot system:

● Update(src/VoxelWorld.js)
  ⎿  Error editing file

✻ Thinking…

  Let me find the exact text of the generateBackpackLoot function. The issue might be that there are slight differences in whitespace 
  or formatting.

● Let me get the exact text of the function to replace it correctly:

● Search(pattern: "generateBackpackLoot.*=>.*\{", path: "src/VoxelWorld.js", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 30 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  I can see there are some differences from what I expected. The function includes flowers that I didn't account for, and there are 
  formatting differences. Let me replace with the exact text shown.

● Perfect! Now I can see the exact function. Let me replace it with the slot-based version:

● Update(src/VoxelWorld.js)
  ⎿  Error editing file

✻ Thinking…

  Let me try using MultiEdit to replace specific parts of the function rather than the whole thing at once. There might be some slight 
  formatting differences that are making the exact match fail.

● Let me try a different approach using MultiEdit to replace the key lines one by one:

● Update(src/VoxelWorld.js)
  ⎿  Updated src/VoxelWorld.js with 13 additions and 5 removals

       518 +              const stoneCount = randomRange(4, 10);
       519 +              this.addToInventory('stone', stoneCount);
       520 +              this.addToInventory('workbench', 1);  // ESSENTIAL - needed for crafting system!

✻ Thinking…

  Great! Let me continue with the remaining lines in the function.

● Good! Let me continue converting the rest of the function:

● Update(src/VoxelWorld.js)
  ⎿  Updated src/VoxelWorld.js with 18 additions and 5 removals

       535 +                  this.addToInventory('glass', glassCount);
       536 +              }

       555                const foundItems = [];

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I need to remove the logging section that iterates over the legacy inventory and replace it with something that doesn't 
  rely on legacy inventory. Let me also remove the this.updateHotbarCounts() call since addToInventory() already handles that.

● Excellent! Now let me replace the logging section and remove the redundant UI update call:

● Update(src/VoxelWorld.js)
