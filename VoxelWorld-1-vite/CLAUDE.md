- Tool-based harvesting with efficiency calculations
- Backpack discovery system with random loot generation
- Keyboard hotbar selection with visual feedback
- Pointer lock management for inventory interaction
- **Workbench System**: Interactive workbench modal with material selection, shape builder, and 3D preview area
- **Full Inventory Management**: Right-click transfers between hotbar and backpack storage
- **Item Placement/Harvesting**: Items properly removed from inventory when placed, harvestable back
- **Smart Notifications**: Enhanced notification system with icons and auto-dismiss
- **Proximity Interaction**: Press E near workbench to open crafting interface
- **Dead Trees**: Rare treasure trees (5% spawn rate) that drop dead_wood + exotic wood from other biomes
- **Specific Wood Types**: Replaced legacy 'wood' with oak_wood, pine_wood, birch_wood, palm_wood, dead_wood
- **Campfire Recipe**: Crafted from 3x any wood type, creates glowing light source (particles disabled due to THREE.js r180 compatibility)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Textured Crafted Objects with Subtle Color Tinting

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Successfully fixed textured crafted objects that were causing THREE.js r180 shader errors:

1. **Fixed Material Array Handling** (VoxelWorld.js:319-360):
   - Discovered `this.materials[material]` returns array of 6 materials (cube faces)
   - Extract first material with `Array.isArray()` check
   - Prevents JavaScript `.map` method confusion with THREE.js texture map

2. **Fresh Texture Creation**:
   - Create new `CanvasTexture` for each crafted object instead of reusing shared references
   - Proper texture configuration (NearestFilter, mipmaps, anisotropy)
   - Eliminates `uvundefined` shader errors caused by shared texture instances

3. **Subtle Color Tinting** (VoxelWorld.js:345-348):
   - Interpolate selected color 70% toward white (30% tint, 70% texture visibility)
   - Uses `tintColor.clone().lerp(white, 0.7)` for lighter tint
   - Textures now clearly visible with subtle color overlay
   - Adjustable tint strength for future ArtBench feature

4. **MeshBasicMaterial Usage**:
   - Switched from MeshLambertMaterial to MeshBasicMaterial for crafted objects
   - Simpler shader without lighting calculations
   - More stable with fresh texture instances

**Result:** Crafted objects (spheres, cylinders, cubes, pyramids) display with proper textures and subtle color tints. Foundation prepared for ArtBench feature to recolor items with exploration materials.

**Code Locations:**
- VoxelWorld.js:319-360 - Material creation with array handling and texture copying
- VoxelWorld.js:345-348 - Color tint interpolation (adjustable from 0.0 to 1.0)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Gold Ore, Compass System, and Adventurer's Menu Redesign (2025-10-04 Evening)

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

This session focused on adding gold as a precious resource, fixing compass recipes, debugging cache issues, and creating a beautiful new menu interface.

1. **Gold Ore Implementation**:
   - Added `gold` block type with texture support (`gold-sides.png`)
   - Spawns every 13 blocks underground (rarer than iron's every 7 blocks)
   - Base harvest time: 3500ms (harder than iron's 3000ms)
   - Stone hammer efficiency: 0.6 (2100ms harvest time)
   - 12% drop chance with stone hammer (vs iron's 15%)
   - Requires stone_hammer or iron tool to harvest
   - Gold ore has golden color (0xFFD700)
   - Added to all block type mappings: ChunkWorker, ChunkSerializer, WorkerManager, VoxelWorld
   - Block type ID: 9

2. **Iron Ore Texture Support**:
   - Added `iron-sides.png` texture support
   - Fixed bug where stone hammer couldn't harvest iron (checked for 'stone' instead of 'stone_hammer')
   - Iron ore now properly textured with multi-face block system
   - Both iron and gold added to EnhancedGraphics candidates and multiFaceBlocks

3. **Compass Recipe Overhaul**:
   - Basic Compass: Changed from 3 iron + 1 stick ‚Üí **3 gold + 1 stick**
   - Makes compass more valuable and end-game worthy
   - Gold is rarer resource, appropriate for navigation tool
   - Updated clues in ToolBenchSystem.js
   - Crystal Compass upgrade still uses compass + 2 crystals

4. **Compass Message Fix**:
   - Changed "none discovered yet in your travels" ‚Üí "but you have not passed by any yet"
   - Clearer messaging that compass searches loaded chunks
   - Helps players understand they need to explore to find targets

5. **Cache Management Utilities** (VoxelWorld.js:5705-5859):
   - **clearAllData()** - Original function (clears localStorage + IndexedDB)
   - **clearCaches()** - NEW! Cache-only clear that preserves saved games
     - Clears sessionStorage, RAM cache, BiomeWorldGen cache, Web Worker cache
     - Deletes ChunkPersistence database (terrain cache)
     - Clears performance benchmarks and tutorial flags
     - **Preserves NebulaWorld localStorage** (saved game data)
   - **nuclearClear()** - Nuclear option (wipes EVERYTHING)
     - Clears all storage, all caches, all memory
     - Hard reload with cache bypass
     - Use when something is seriously broken

6. **üé® Adventurer's Menu Redesign** (VoxelWorld.js:9306-9644):
   - Complete visual overhaul matching Adventurer's Journal aesthetic
   - **Parchment Theme**: Brown leather gradients, golden corner decorations, Georgia serif font

   - **Better Organization**: Grouped related settings, clear section headers
   - **Visual Polish**: Hover effects, active tab highlighting, smooth transitions
   - **Displays Info**: World seed, GPU name, helpful tooltips
   - **Tab Switching Logic**: JavaScript-powered tab navigation (VoxelWorld.js:9647-9675)
   - **CSS Hover Effects**: Buttons lift and brighten on hover (VoxelWorld.js:9648-9664)

7. **Debugging Session**:
   - Investigated random bedrock blocks above ground
   - Found on-demand underground generation in getBlock() (VoxelWorld.js:824-866)
   - Discovered generateTerrainAt() height clamping to max 12 (old code from before tall mountains)
   - Temporarily disabled on-demand generation to test - broke underground block access
   - Re-enabled quickly - code is needed for mining collision detection
   - nuclearClear() confirmed bedrock was from old cached data, not new generation bug

**Code Locations:**
- VoxelWorld.js:6082-6083 - Gold block type definition
- VoxelWorld.js:1929 - Gold emoji icon (üü° temporary)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Tree Generation System Overhaul (2025-10-05)

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

This session fixed critical tree generation bugs that prevented trees from spawning properly and caused floating canopy issues.

#### üêõ **Six Critical Bugs Fixed:**

1. **Tree Density Multipliers Too Low** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1285-1295):
   - **Problem**: Multipliers were reduced from 2-12 down to 0.03-0.20, making trees virtually impossible to spawn
   - **Fix**: Doubled all multipliers back to proper values
     - Forest: 0.15 ‚Üí 16 (100x increase!)
     - Plains: 0.08 ‚Üí 20 (250x increase!)
     - Mountains: 0.12 ‚Üí 20
     - Desert: 0.03 ‚Üí 4
     - Tundra: 0.05 ‚Üí 6
   - **Result**: Trees now spawn with noise-based distribution at proper density

2. **Tree Placement Height Search Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7204):
   - **Problem**: Surface search only checked up to y=15, but mountains go to y=30 (mega mountains y=60!)
   - **Fix**: Extended search range from y=15 ‚Üí y=64
   - Added check for 'air' blocks to properly detect surface
   - **Result**: Trees can now spawn on tall mountains

3. **Tree Save/Load Scan Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7718):
   - **Problem**: When unloading chunks, only scanned y=1-20 for tree trunks
   - Trees above y=20 weren't saved, causing them to disappear on chunk reload
   - **Fix**: Extended scan range from y=20 ‚Üí y=65 for tree trunk detection
   - **Result**: Mountain trees properly persist across chunk unload/reload

4. **Chunk Unload Cleanup Range Too Low** (VoxelWorld.js:7764):
   - **Problem**: Only removed blocks up to y=20 when unloading chunks
   - Tall mountain tree canopies at y=30-40 were left behind as "ghost" blocks
   - **Fix**: Extended cleanup range from y=20 ‚Üí y=70 to remove ALL tree blocks
   - **Result**: No more floating canopies after walking away and returning!

5. **Implemented Chunk-Based Tree Counter System** (BiomeWorldGen.js:33-41, 1023-1048, 1206-1248):
   - **Problem**: Even with noise-based generation, tree distribution was too sparse and unpredictable
   - **Solution**: Added guaranteed minimum tree density system
   - **Guaranteed Tree Intervals**:
     - Forest: 1 tree per chunk (every chunk gets a tree!)
     - Plains: 1 tree per 3 chunks (~35 trees in 105-chunk walk)
     - Mountains: 1 tree per 2 chunks
     - Desert: 1 tree per 5 chunks (sparse)
     - Tundra: 1 tree per 4 chunks
   - Places guaranteed tree in center of qualifying chunks
   - Works ALONGSIDE noise-based system for natural variation
   - **Result**: Players never walk 100+ chunks without seeing trees

6. **Fixed Variable Redeclaration Bug** (BiomeWorldGen.js:1299):
   - **Problem**: `centerX`, `centerZ`, `chunkBiome` declared twice in same scope
   - **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration, reused variables from chunk counter logic
   - **Result**: No TypeScript/JavaScript errors

#### üå≥ **How the Dual Tree System Works:**

The new system uses TWO complementary methods:

1. **Noise-Based Trees** (Enhanced):
   - Random, natural placement using Perlin noise
   - 2x more likely to spawn than before
   - Creates organic, varied tree clusters
   - Respects biome-specific multipliers

2. **Guaranteed Trees** (New):
   - Forces 1 tree in chunk center every N chunks (based on biome)
   - Ensures minimum coverage even if noise check fails
   - Skips spacing restrictions to ensure placement
   - Tracks per-biome counters for proper distribution

3. **Result**:
   - Natural distribution + minimum coverage guarantee
   - No more 100+ chunk walks without trees
   - Forests feel like forests, plains have scattered trees
   - Deserts remain sparse but not completely barren

#### üìç **Code Locations:**

**BiomeWorldGen.js:**
- Lines 33-41: Chunk tree counter initialization and interval configuration
- Lines 1023-1048: Chunk-level tree counting logic (determines if guaranteed tree needed)
- Lines 1206-1248: Dual tree placement system (noise + guaranteed)
- Lines 1285-1295: Doubled tree density multipliers
- Line 1299: Fixed variable redeclaration

**VoxelWorld.js:**
- Line 7204: Extended tree surface search from y=15 ‚Üí y=64
- Line 7206: Added 'air' block check for proper surface detection
- Line 7718: Extended tree save scan from y=20 ‚Üí y=65
- Line 7764: Extended chunk cleanup from y=20 ‚Üí y=70 (fixes floating canopies!)

#### ‚úÖ **Testing Checklist:**

After clearing cache (`window.voxelApp.clearCaches()`), you should see:
- ‚úÖ Trees at spawn with no floating canopies
- ‚úÖ Regular tree spawns while exploring (at least every 3 chunks in Plains)
- ‚úÖ Tall mountain trees spawn properly on peaks
- ‚úÖ Mountain trees persist after chunk unload/reload
- ‚úÖ No ghost canopies after walking away and returning to an area
- ‚úÖ Forest biomes feel dense with trees
- ‚úÖ Desert biomes have sparse but visible trees

#### üéØ **Known Issues:**

**Spawn Zone Behavior:**
- Spawn zone has special clearing logic that may affect trees differently
- If trees disappear at spawn but canopies remain, this is the spawn safety system
- Not a critical bug - just spawn zone mechanics

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adjusting guaranteed tree intervals if density feels too high/low
- Could add debug mode to visualize guaranteed tree positions
- May want biome-variant-specific intervals (dense_forest vs sparse_forest)

### Latest Session - Dead Trees, Wood Types, and Campfire System (Previous)
1. **Dead Trees with Treasure Loot**:
   - 5% spawn chance in any biome during tree generation
   - 1-3 blocks tall with 1-2 withered dead_wood-leaves
   - Drops treasure loot: 2-4 dead_wood + optional exotic wood from other biomes + optional stone
   - Integrated with tree registry and harvesting system

2. **Specific Wood Types Throughout Codebase**:
   - Replaced all legacy 'wood' references with specific types (oak_wood, pine_wood, birch_wood, palm_wood, dead_wood)
   - Fixed backpack loot generation to give random wood type instead of generic 'wood'
   - Updated workbench recipes to accept any wood type with flexible material matching

3. **Campfire Crafting System**:

   - Creates cylinder mesh with orange/red emissive material
   - THREE.PointLight provides warm flickering glow (1.5 intensity, 10 unit range)
   - **Fire particles disabled**: THREE.Points particle system caused shader errors in THREE.js r180
   - Effect metadata stored in crafted items for future extensibility

4. **THREE.js r180 Compatibility Issues Identified**:
   - THREE.Points particles cause "can't access property 'elements' of undefined" shader error
   - Error originates from `refreshTransformUniform` in THREE.js render pipeline
   - Particles disabled in campfire but glow light works perfectly
   - Billboard system (enhanced PNG textures) works fine - not the cause of shader errors

   - Fixed renderer sizing issues (0x0 ‚Üí proper container dimensions)
   - Fixed JavaScript crashes in THREE.js getSize() calls
   - Interactive 3D preview with mouse drag/zoom/pan controls

2. **Smart Material Filtering**: Dynamic recipe filtering based on material selection
   - Visual selection indicators (golden borders) for selected materials
   - Recipe book filters to show only craftable items with selected materials
   - Reset button to clear selections and show all recipes
   - Multi-material selection support with Set-based state management

3. **Complete Recipe System**: Full recipe book with basic shapes and complex structures
   - Basic shapes: Cube, Sphere, Cylinder, Pyramid, Stairs, Wall, Hollow Cube
   - Complex structures: Castle Wall, Tower Turret, Simple House
   - Material requirements system with inventory integration
   - Shape size scaling based on available material quantities

   - Multiple variants per biome (dense_forest, rocky_desert, oasis, etc.)
   - Dynamic property modifications (tree density, shrub chance, surface blocks)
   - Safe height range enforcement for all variants
   - Biome-specific tree clustering and distribution

5. **üìä Production-Ready Logging**:
   - Debug mode flag (DEBUG_MODE = false for production)
   - Statistical tracking without verbose logging
   - Reduced log frequency (every 10th chunk, 128th block)
   - Emergency alerts for critical issues only
   - Performance monitoring with chunk generation stats

6. **üîß Debug & Control Methods**:
   - `enableDebugMode()` / `disableDebugMode()` for development

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Climate-Based Biome Generation & Terrain Height System

**üåç Session Focus: Implementing Minecraft-Style Biome Selection + Tall Mountains**

Successfully implemented a complete climate-based biome generation system with temperature and moisture maps, increased terrain heights, spawn point safety improvements, and water level adjustments.

#### Major Systems Implemented:

1. **üå°Ô∏è Climate-Based Biome Generation (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 712-780)**:
   - **Temperature Map**: North-south gradient (-1 cold to +1 hot) with noise variation
   - **Moisture Map**: Perlin noise for wet/dry regions (-1 dry to +1 wet)
   - **Biome Selection Grid**: Climate zones determine biome placement
     - Cold + Dry = Tundra
     - Cold + Wet = Forest
     - Hot + Dry = Desert
     - Temperate + Wet = Forest
     - Temperate + Moderate = Plains/Mountain
   - **Result**: Geographic biome placement - no more snow next to deserts!

   ```javascript
   // Key implementation - Temperature gradient with noise
   getTemperature(x, z, seed) {
       const latitudeGradient = z * 0.003; // North-south gradient
       const temperatureNoise = this.multiOctaveNoise(
           x * 0.5, z * 0.5,
           { scale: 0.002, octaves: 3, persistence: 0.5 },
           seed + 1000
       );
       return latitudeGradient + temperatureNoise * 0.3;
   }
   ```

2. **üèîÔ∏è Increased Terrain Heights (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 39-122)**:
   - **Plains**: y=3-6 (gentle rolling hills)
   - **Forest**: y=4-10 (forested hills)
   - **Desert**: y=3-8 (sand dunes for mining)
   - **Mountains**: y=15-30 (tall mountains, previously y=8-20)
   - **Tundra**: y=4-10 (icy hills)
   - **Mega Mountains**: y=40-60 (rare super mountains in mountain biomes only)

   **Super Mountain System** (lines 783-808):
   - Noise-based modifier creates rare mega mountains (>0.7 threshold)
   - Only applies to mountain biomes
   - Smooth height transition from normal (y=30) to mega (y=60)
   - Intentionally hollow for future multi-layer dungeon integration

3. **üåä Water System Improvements (ChunkWorker.js lines 140-150)**:
   - **Water Level**: Lowered from y=4 to y=3 to reduce floating water blocks
   - **Water Fill**: Fills empty space from terrain height to y=3
   - **Biome Integration**: Water level stays below biome ground level
   - **Known Issue**: Some floating water blocks at chunk boundaries (acceptable for now)

4. **üéØ Spawn Point Safety System (VoxelWorld.js lines 6266-6324)**:
   - **Height Search**: Changed from y=15 to y=64 to detect tall mountains
   - **Solid Ground Check**: Requires 3+ solid blocks below spawn point
   - **Clear Space Above**: 6-block vertical clearance for player
   - **Result**: No more spawning inside hollow mountains!

   ```javascript
   // Key fix - Check solid ground below spawn
   let solidBlocksBelow = 0;
   for (let checkY = y - 1; checkY >= Math.max(0, y - 5); checkY--) {
       const belowBlock = this.getBlock(checkX, checkY, checkZ);
       if (belowBlock) solidBlocksBelow++;
   }
   if (solidBlocksBelow < 3) return false; // Not safe spawn
   ```

5. **üé® Noise Parameter Tuning (BiomeWorldGen.js lines 170-175)**:
   - **Problem**: "Borg cube" artifacts - perfect 8√ó8 cubes at chunk boundaries
   - **Iteration 1**: scale: 0.012 (original) - TOO sharp, created vertical cliffs
   - **Iteration 2**: scale: 0.003 - TOO smooth, created flat plateaus
   - **Final Balance**: scale: 0.008, octaves: 5, persistence: 0.55
   - **Result**: Natural slopes with some remaining artifacts (user accepted)

   ```javascript
   elevation: {
       scale: 0.008,      // Balanced for natural slopes
       octaves: 5,        // More detail layers
       persistence: 0.55  // Moderate detail level
   }
   ```

6. **üÜî Biome Display Enhancement (VoxelWorld.js line 6480)**:
   - Added `id="current-biome-display"` for easy DOM access
   - **Known Issue**: Sometimes shows "Plains" when standing on mountains (height-based detection needs fixing)

- Chunk persistence and caching system (RAM + disk)

#### Known Issues & Intentional Features:

**‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues:**
1. **Borg Cubes**: Some chunk boundary artifacts remain (noise tuning improved but not perfect)
2. **Floating Water**: Occasional water blocks floating near tall terrain (reduced by lowering water level)
3. **Biome Labeling**: Display shows "Plains" when standing on mountains (height-based detection bug)

**‚úÖ Intentional Features (NOT bugs):**
1. **Hollow Mountains**: Mountains generate hollow for future dungeon integration with VoxelWorld-2
2. **Floating Islands**: User finds them exciting and wants to keep as special features
3. **Spawn Zone Resources**: Trees/rocks near spawn are non-persistent (fresh starts on world reset)

#### Testing Notes:

User tested with `clearAllData()` + force refresh:
- Spawn point: Natural slopes, easy to escape (not a perfect Borg cube)
- Floating islands: Still present, user likes them as fun exploration features
- Water blocks: Mostly working with 54-64 water blocks per chunk in low areas
- Mountains: Properly tall (y=15-30), hollow interiors work as intended

#### Next Steps (Tomorrow's Work):

1. **Fix Biome Labeling** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - Plains showing when standing on mountains
   - Need height-aware biome detection

2. **Hollow Out Mountains with 3D Cave Systems** (HIGH PRIORITY):
   - Use Perlin worms to carve natural cave networks
   - Multi-layer dungeon integration for mega mountains
   - Leave mountain exteriors intact

3. **Further Terrain Smoothing** (MEDIUM PRIORITY):
   - Additional noise parameter tuning to reduce Borg cubes
   - Possible biome boundary blending improvements

4. **Floating Islands as Intentional Feature** (OPTIONAL):
   - Make them special with quest markers or rare loot
   - Add visual indicators (glow, particles, special blocks)

5. **Test Spawn and Water Fixes** (IN PROGRESS):
   - Verify spawn point always safe
   - Monitor water block generation logs
   - Check for edge cases with extreme terrain
