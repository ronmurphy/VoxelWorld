### Key Systems

- **Chunk System**: 8x8 block chunks with configurable render distance
- **Biome Generation**: Climate-based (temperature + moisture) terrain generation
  - Plains (y=3-6), Forest (y=4-10), Desert (y=3-8), Mountains (y=15-30), Tundra (y=4-10)
  - Mega Mountains (y=40-60) - rare super mountains with hollow interiors for dungeons
- **Web Workers**: Background chunk and tree generation with WorkerManager, ChunkWorker, and TreeWorker
  - **TreeWorker**: Dedicated worker for tree placement (off main thread for smooth performance)
  - **ChunkWorker**: Terrain generation + simple LOD trees for distant chunks
  - **WorkerManager**: Orchestrates ChunkWorker ‚Üí TreeWorker pipeline
- **Caching**: Hybrid RAM (ChunkCache) + Disk (ChunkPersistence/IndexedDB) system
- **Tree System**: Worker-based procedural tree generation (50% reduced density for performance)
  - **Regular trees**: Noise-based placement with 3-block minimum spacing

  - **Dead trees**: 5% spawn in regular chunks with treasure loot
  - **LOD trees**: Simple colored blocks (brown trunk + green canopy) in distant LOD chunks
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Known visual mismatch**: LOD trees visible in distance chunks do NOT match actual trees that generate when full chunks load (LOD uses simplified noise, full chunks use TreeWorker with spacing logic)
- **Resource Gathering**: Biome-specific shrubs, ores (iron, gold), and collectibles
- **Billboard System**: Floating emoji sprites (backpack üéí, ghosts üëª, shrubs üåø)

  - LOD chunks show simplified terrain (biome surface colors only)
  - LOD chunks auto-unload when full chunks load in same position
  - Hard fog ends at render distance, so LOD chunks appear through/past fog wall

### Technologies

- **Three.js r180** - 3D rendering engine
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server
- **Electron** - Desktop application wrapper
- **Capacitor** - Mobile app framework (configured but not actively used)

## Game Controls

### Keyboard Controls
- **WASD** - Movement
- **Space** - Jump
- **Mouse** - Look around (requires pointer lock)
- **Left Click** - Hold to harvest blocks (tool-based efficiency)
- **Right Click** - Place blocks from inventory
- **Keys 1-4** - Select hotbar slots
- **Key 5** - Toggle backpack inventory
- **Q/E** - Navigate hotbar slots
- **E** - Interact (workbench, toolbench)
- **M** - Toggle World Map (Explorer's Journal)
- **C** - Toggle Companion Codex
- **L** - Toggle LOD Debug Overlay (development tool)
- **ESC** - Close modals (workbench, toolbench, backpack)

### Mobile Controls
- **Left Joystick** - Movement
- **Right Joystick** - Look around
- **Touch Hotbar** - Select items

## Current Architecture Issues

### VoxelWorld.js (10,900+ lines - TOO LARGE)

**Still needs extraction:**
- Physics system (collision, movement, gravity)
- BlockTypes definitions and materials
- Player controller (input, camera)
- UI systems (notifications, minimap, mobile joysticks)
- Save/load system
- Main game loop and orchestration
- Combat system (pending - will be extracted to BattleSystem.js)

**Goal:** Reduce to <2000 lines (orchestrator only)

## Important Technical Notes

### Block Type Synchronization
Block type IDs must stay synchronized across:
- `VoxelWorld.js` - BlockTypes definition
- `ChunkWorker.js` - Worker generation
- `ChunkSerializer.js` - Serialization
- `WorkerManager.js` - Deserialization

### THREE.js r180 Compatibility
- THREE.Points particles cause shader errors - avoid using
- Use Billboard sprites (SpriteMaterial) instead for floating elements
- Fresh CanvasTexture instances required for crafted objects (no shared references)

### Pointer Lock Management
- Pointer lock must be released when opening ANY modal (Map, Codex, Chat, Workbench, ToolBench)
- Only re-engage pointer lock when CLOSING modals completely (Close button, ESC key, toggle key)
- DO NOT re-engage when switching between related modals (bookmark tab navigation)
- Chat.js checks for open workbench/toolbench before re-engaging
- Bookmark clicks pass `reEngagePointerLock: false` to `hide()` methods

### Cache Management
Console utilities (exposed via `window.voxelApp`):
- `clearCaches()` - Clear caches but preserve saved games
- `clearAllData()` - Clear localStorage + IndexedDB
- `nuclearClear()` - Nuclear option (wipe everything + hard reload)

### Intentional "Bugs" (Features)
- **Hollow Mountains**: For future dungeon integration
- **Floating Islands**: Rare occurrence, kept as special exploration feature
- **Pillar Trees**: Trees on stone columns - quirky aesthetic kept intentionally
- **Mega Ancient Palm Trees**: Inverted canopy effect in desert - alien monument aesthetic

### üåæ **Farming & Agriculture System** ‚úÖ (COMPLETED - 2025-10-10)

**Status: FULLY IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ**

Complete farming system with tilling, planting, watering mechanics, particle effects, and crop growth. Players can now farm crops with 2x growth speed when watered!

**Implemented Features:**

1. **‚úÖ Tilled Soil System**:
   - Hoe tool crafted from 2 wood + 1 stick (ToolBench)
   - Left-click grass/dirt with hoe to till into farmland (auto-works from any playerbar slot)
   - Tilled soil reverts to dirt if not planted within 24 in-game days

2. **‚úÖ Seed System**:
   - Seed items: wheat_seeds, carrot_seeds, pumpkin_seeds, berry_seeds
   - Seeds obtained from:
     - Grass blocks: 10% chance wheat_seeds, 8% chance carrot_seeds
     - Pumpkins: Always drop pumpkin_seeds
     - Shrubs: Always drop berry_seeds (re-enabled in TreeWorker)
   - Right-click tilled soil with seeds to plant

3. **‚úÖ Crop Growth Stages**:
   - 3 visual stages per crop: sprout ‚Üí young ‚Üí mature
   - Growth rates (base):
     - Wheat/Carrot: 10 in-game days per stage (30 days total)
     - Pumpkin: 15 in-game days per stage (45 days total)
     - Berry Bush: 12 in-game days per stage (36 days total)
   - **Watered crops grow 2x faster** (5 days per stage for wheat/carrot!)
   - Real-time growth tracking with CropGrowthManager

4. **‚úÖ Watering System**:
   - Watering can crafted from 3 iron + 1 stick (ToolBench)
   - Auto-works from any playerbar slot (no need to select)
   - Right-click crops to water ‚Üí **Beautiful particle animation with 15 falling water droplets**
   - Watering lasts 1 in-game day, then expires
   - Prevents double-watering: "üíß Crop is already watered!"
   - Proper memory cleanup (all geometries/materials disposed after animation)

5. **‚úÖ Harvesting System**:
   - Left-click fully grown crop to harvest
   - Returns crop item + seeds for replanting
   - Yield multiplier: Watered crops yield 2x items

**Implementation Files:**
- `src/FarmingSystem.js` - Main farming logic (tilling, planting, watering, harvesting)
- `src/FarmingBlockTypes.js` - Block type definitions for farming
- `src/CropGrowthManager.js` - Growth stage tracking, watering timers, `isWatered()` method
- `src/AnimationSystem.js` - Watering particle effect with 15 droplets
- `src/ToolBenchSystem.js` - Hoe and watering can recipes
- `src/workers/TreeWorker.js` - Shrubs re-enabled for berry seeds
- `src/VoxelWorld.js` - Integrated farming handlers, auto-work detection
- `src/EnhancedGraphics.js` - Watering can texture mappings

**How to Use:**
1. Harvest grass blocks to get wheat/carrot seeds
2. Craft hoe at ToolBench (2 wood + 1 stick)
3. Left-click grass/dirt with hoe to till soil
4. Right-click tilled soil with seeds to plant
5. Craft watering can (3 iron + 1 stick)
6. Right-click crops to water ‚Üí See beautiful water animation! üíß
7. Wait for crops to grow (5 days per stage if watered, 10 days if not)
8. Left-click mature crops to harvest (2x yield if watered!)

**Debug Commands:**
```javascript
giveItem('hoe')              // Auto-unlocks UI + gives hoe
giveItem('watering_can')     // Gives watering can
giveItem('wheat_seeds')      // Gives wheat seeds for testing
```

### High Priority Features
1. **Greedy Meshing**: Required for ocean biome (10,000 water blocks = 10,000 draw calls currently)
2. **3D Cave Systems**: Perlin worms to carve natural caves in hollow mountains
3. **Ruins Generation**: Not spawning consistently (check BiomeWorldGen spawn rates)

### Medium Priority Bugs
1. **Biome Labeling Bug**: Shows "Plains" when on mountains (height-based detection issue)
2. **Terrain Smoothing**: Reduce "Borg cube" artifacts at chunk boundaries
3. **Drag & Drop Inventory**: Currently only right-click transfer works

### Long-Term Refactoring
1. **Continue VoxelWorld.js Refactoring**: Extract Physics, PlayerController, UI, SaveLoad (reduce from 10,900+ lines to <2000)

### Future Features / Ideas to Implement

   - Keyboard shortcut (`` ` `` or `F3`) to toggle
   - File: `src/dev/DevConsole.js` + `src/ui/DevModal.js`
   - Benefits: Discoverable, organized, easier testing, clean code separation
   
2. **üê± Cat Companions System** üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
   - Black cats (Sargem variant!), tabbies, calicos, orange boys
   - Adoptable kittens found in world or rescued
   - Follow player, sit on workbenches, general adorableness
   - Special tribute to Brad's foster work (10+ years, neonatal care)
