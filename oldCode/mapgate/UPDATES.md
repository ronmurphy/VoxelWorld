# MapGate ShapeForge Updates

## September 13, 2025 - Major ShapeForge Enhancements

### üéØ Workspace Expansion System
- **Configurable Workspace Size**: Replaced hardcoded 10x10x10 workspace with user-configurable sizing
- **Modal Dialog Interface**: Added Shoelace-based modal for selecting workspace dimensions (1x1x1 to 50x50x50)
- **Dynamic Grid Updates**: Three.js GridHelper now dynamically resizes based on workspace selection
- **Save Format v1.3**: Extended save format to include `workspaceSize` metadata
- **Backward Compatibility**: Adaptive sizing algorithm analyzes v1.2 projects and calculates appropriate workspace bounds

### üì± Mobile Optimization System
- **New File Format**: Introduced `.shapeforge.mobile` format for Android-optimized models
- **Geometry Optimization**: 
  - Vertex merging with configurable tolerance
  - Polygon reduction algorithms
  - Precision rounding for file size reduction
- **Texture Optimization**: 
  - Canvas-based image resizing and compression
  - Base64 texture optimization
- **Material Simplification**: Streamlined material properties for mobile performance
- **Real-time Preview**: Three.js canvas preview with optimization statistics
- **Progress Tracking**: Live progress bars and reduction percentage display

### üîß Core Fixes & Improvements
- **Camera Controls Cleanup**: Removed broken camera control buttons and dead code
- **Browse Samples Fix**: Fixed 404 errors in sample file browser by correcting path extraction
- **Geometry Compatibility**: Added support for both `indices` and `faces` formats for backward compatibility with complex geometry files
- **Import Button**: Commented out redundant "Import JSON" button to reduce UI clutter

### üåê Cross-Platform Updates
Updated all ShapeForge implementations to ensure consistency:
- `/extras/mapgate/js/classes/ShapeForge.js` (MapGate version)
- `/maped3d-main/js/classes/ShapeForge.js` (MapEd3D version)  
- `/v5/3d-integration/ShapeForge.js` (V5 integration version)

### üìä Technical Achievements
- **Smart Optimization**: System intelligently preserves quality when content is already optimized
- **Resource Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management for preview canvases
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering pipeline for mobile preview system

### üé® UI/UX Enhancements
- **Shoelace Components**: Modern web components for modal dialogs and progress indicators
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear progress tracking and optimization statistics
- **Mobile Preview**: Real-time preview canvas showing optimized results
- **Streamlined Interface**: Removed redundant controls and improved workflow

### üß™ Testing & Validation
- **Sample Compatibility**: Verified with FireMarker (94 vertices, 0% reduction - already optimized)
- **Complex Geometry**: Tested with mountain sample (19 vertices, 4.9% reduction)
- **Cross-browser**: Ensured compatibility across different devices and browsers
- **Backward Compatibility**: Confirmed v1.2 projects load and adapt correctly

### üîÆ Future Considerations
- Additional shape primitives (user feedback dependent)
- Gradient material support
- Enhanced texture management
- Performance profiling tools

## Key Files Modified
- `js/classes/ShapeForge.js` - Core functionality and mobile optimization
- `assets/sampleObjects/ShapeForge/` - Sample files with mixed format support
- UI components integrated with Shoelace framework

## Breaking Changes
- Save format upgraded to v1.3 (backward compatible)
- Mobile optimization requires modern browser Canvas API support

## Notes
- Mobile optimization shows 0% reduction on already-optimized content (by design)
- Complex geometry files (like mountain.shapeforge.json) now render properly
- All three ShapeForge implementations maintain feature parity
