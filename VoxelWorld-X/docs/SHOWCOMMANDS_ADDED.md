- You were correct - we didn't have `setSeed()` and `clearSeed()` before! They were just added in this session.
- The `showCommands()` function makes ALL commands discoverable
- This helps both users AND AI assistants know what's available
- Color formatting uses console `%c` style tags for better readability
