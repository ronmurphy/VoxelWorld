## ‚öîÔ∏è **Combat System**

### **Universal Luck System** üçÄ
The core of DCC combat is the **Luck System** - a dynamic mechanic that scales with character progression:

#### **Luck Dice Formula**
- **Every 10 levels**: Gain +1d10 to your luck pool
- **Level 1-9**: 1d10 luck
- **Level 10-19**: 2d10 luck  
- **Level 20-29**: 3d10 luck
- **Level 30+**: 4d10+ luck (for legendary heroes!)

#### **To-Hit Resolution**
Combat uses **opposed rolls** rather than static target numbers:

1. **Attacker rolls**: Weapon dice + Attribute + Luck dice
   - **Melee**: d20 + STR + weapon bonus + luck (Xd10)
   - **Ranged**: d20 + DEX + weapon bonus + luck (Xd10)

2. **Defender rolls**: Defense + Attribute + Luck dice  
   - **Defense roll**: d20 + DEX + armor bonus + luck (Xd10)

3. **Hit Resolution**: If attacker's total is **+3 or higher** than defender's total ‚Üí HIT!
   - **Example**: Attacker rolls 18, Defender rolls 14 ‚Üí 18-14=4 ‚Üí HIT! 
   - **Example**: Attacker rolls 16, Defender rolls 15 ‚Üí 16-15=1 ‚Üí MISS!

### **Initiative System** ‚ö°
Turn order is determined by **DEX + Luck**:
- **Roll**: d20 + DEX + luck dice (Xd10)
- **Highest total goes first**, then descending order
- **Ties**: Highest DEX wins, then highest level

### **Damage System**
- **Light Weapons**: d4 + attribute modifier
- **Medium Weapons**: d6 + attribute modifier
- **Heavy Weapons**: d8 + attribute modifier
- **Two-Handed**: Some weapons require both hands but deal more damage
- **Critical Hits**: When you beat defender by 10+, roll damage twice!

### **Defense & Health**
- **Health Points**: CON + Character Level
- **Magic Points**: WIS + INT  
- **Armor Bonus**: Adds to defense roll (not static AC)
- **Equipment Bonuses**: Achievements can enhance weapon/armor effectiveness

### **Why This System Rocks** üé∏
- **Scales Naturally**: High-level fights stay exciting with more luck dice
- **No Inflation**: No need for +50 weapons at high levels
- **Dramatic Swings**: Luck can turn the tide at any moment
- **Balanced Chaos**: Skill matters, but fortune favors the bold!

## üìä **The Mathematics Behind the Screen**

### **Why These Numbers?**

#### **Starting at 2 (Not 10)**
- **Faster Math**: Smaller numbers = quicker calculations
- **Meaningful Growth**: Every point matters more
- **Beginner Friendly**: Less intimidating than large numbers

#### **3 Points Per Level**  
- **Steady Growth**: Consistent character improvement
- **Choice Matters**: Meaningful decisions each level
- **No Waste**: Always exactly what you need

#### **Every 3rd Level Skills**
- **Paced Progression**: Not overwhelming with choices
- **Milestone Feel**: Skills feel like earned rewards  
- **Strategic Planning**: Players think ahead

#### **Rarity Mathematics**
The achievement system uses **level-based algorithms**:
```
Common % = max(20, 50 - level)
Rare % = min(25, level * 0.5)  
Epic % = max(0, (level - 10) * 0.75)
Legendary % = max(0, (level - 20) * 0.25)
```

This ensures **appropriate power progression** without overwhelming new players or boring veterans.
