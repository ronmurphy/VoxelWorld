# Greedy Mesh Electron Texture Loading - Debug Status

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Session:** Continuation #4
**Status:** In Progress - 70% context used

## Problem Summary
Greedy mesh blocks render as see-through colored blocks with no textures in Electron production build. This is because `THREE.TextureLoader.loadAsync()` cannot load `file://` URLs properly in Electron.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE Environment Variable (FIXED)
- **Issue:** VSCode sets `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, which causes `require('electron')` to return a path string instead of the Electron API object
- **Solution:** Added `unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE &&` to npm scripts in package.json
- **Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Electron now starts properly
- **Reference:** https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/8200

### 2. Atlas Texture Loading Failure (IN PROGRESS)
- **Issue:** `THREE.TextureLoader.loadAsync()` hangs/fails on `file://` URLs in Electron
- **Attempted Solution:** Created `RuntimeAtlasGenerator.js` to dynamically generate atlas at runtime by loading individual textures and assembling them on canvas
- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è IN PROGRESS - RuntimeAtlasGenerator created but not executing properly

## Current State

### What Works
- ‚úÖ Electron starts correctly with GPU flags enabled
- ‚úÖ Pre-built atlas.png (870KB) exists at `dist/art/atlas.png`
- ‚úÖ Atlas key (atlas-key.json) has 39 textures mapped correctly
- ‚úÖ Greedy meshing algorithm works (chunks render as colored blocks)
- ‚úÖ RuntimeAtlasGenerator class created with proper error handling

### What Doesn't Work
- ‚ùå RuntimeAtlasGenerator.loadAtlas() doesn't appear to be called/executing
- ‚ùå Console shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Atlas key not loaded, using fallback UVs"
- ‚ùå Console shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è Atlas material not available, using vertex colors fallback"
- ‚ùå No "üé® loadAtlas() called - starting..." log appears in console

## Files Modified

### New Files Created
1. **src/meshing/RuntimeAtlasGenerator.js**
   - Generates texture atlas at runtime from individual block textures
   - Uses canvas to assemble 2048x2048 atlas with 128x128 tiles
   - Returns THREE.CanvasTexture and UV key
   - Uses `window.electronAPI.readFile()` for Electron compatibility

### Modified Files
1. **package.json** (lines 15-17)
   ```json
   "start": "unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && electron .",
   "electron": "unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && electron .",
   "electron-dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev\" \"wait-on http://localhost:5173 && unset ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE && electron .\"",
   ```

2. **electron.cjs** (lines 1-18)
   - Re-enabled GPU flags after fixing ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE issue
   - Added comments about Electron API loading

3. **src/rendering/ChunkMeshManager.js**
   - Imported RuntimeAtlasGenerator
   - Replaced loadAtlas() to use runtime generation instead of THREE.TextureLoader
   - Added extensive console.log debugging

## Next Steps for Session #5

### Immediate Debug Steps
1. **Check if loadAtlas() is being called at all**
   - Look for "üé® loadAtlas() called - starting..." in console
   - If missing, the constructor might not be calling it properly

2. **Verify fileList.json exists in dist**
   - Check: `dist/art/blocks/fileList.json`
   - This is needed by RuntimeAtlasGenerator.getTextureFileList()

3. **Check electron-preload.cjs**
   - Verify `window.electronAPI.readFile()` is exposed properly
   - This is required for loading files in Electron

### Likely Issues (VERIFIED STATUS)
1. **Constructor timing:** `loadAtlas()` IS being called (line 45 in ChunkMeshManager constructor) ‚úÖ
2. **Missing fileList.json:** File EXISTS at dist/art/blocks/fileList.json ‚úÖ
3. **Preload API missing:** `window.electronAPI.readFile()` IS exposed in electron-preload.cjs ‚úÖ
4. **Silent failure in catch block:** loadAtlas() is likely throwing an error that's being caught and logged with console.error, but atlas loading continues with fallback. Check if "‚ùå Failed to load atlas:" appears in console.
5. **Image loading issue:** The RuntimeAtlasGenerator uses Image elements to load textures with `file://` URLs - these might be failing the same way THREE.TextureLoader did

### Alternative Approaches If Runtime Generation Fails
1. **Use pre-built atlas with data URL:** Convert atlas.png to base64 data URL during build
2. **Use Electron native file reading:** Read atlas.png as buffer in main process, send to renderer as base64
3. **Fallback to per-block textures:** Load individual textures instead of atlas (slower but works)

## Key Technical Details

### Atlas Specifications
- **Atlas size:** 2048x2048px
- **Tile size:** 128x128px
- **Grid:** 16x16 (256 slots total, 39 used)
- **Textures:** 39 block textures with variants (-sides, -top-bottom, -all)

### Electron Environment
- **Working directory:** `/home/brad/Documents/VoxelWorld-1/VoxelWorld-1-vite`
- **Production build:** `dist/` folder
- **Node version:** v22.20.0
- **Electron version:** ^38.3.0

### Important Paths
- Atlas image: `dist/art/atlas.png`
- Atlas key: `dist/art/atlas-key.json`
- Block textures: `assets/art/blocks/*.png`
- File manifest: `assets/art/blocks/fileList.json` ‚Üí needs to copy to `dist/art/blocks/fileList.json`

## Console Logs to Look For (Next Session)

When working:
```
üé® loadAtlas() called - starting...
üé® Starting runtime atlas generation...
üé® RuntimeAtlasGenerator created
üé® Getting texture file list...
üé® RuntimeAtlasGenerator: Loading texture list from manifest (Electron)...
üé® Found 39 texture files to load
üé® RuntimeAtlasGenerator: Starting atlas generation for 39 textures...
üé® RuntimeAtlasGenerator: Loaded 10/39 textures...
...
‚úÖ Runtime atlas generated: {width: 2048, height: 2048, textures: 39}
‚úÖ Atlas texture and key loaded successfully - ready for meshing!
```

Currently seeing (broken):
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Atlas key not loaded, using fallback UVs
‚ö†Ô∏è Atlas material not available, using vertex colors fallback
```
